## Glory of the Giants

Myths, fairy tales, folklore, and fantasy literature throughout the real world depict a tremendous range of giants. Some tales suggest that the humans of past ages were gigantic, and the relatively small stature of present-day humans is a mark of their degeneracy. Others imagine remote realms—cloud castles or lost continents—where Brobdingnagian people dwell, set apart from their puny relatives.

In the worlds of Dungeons & Dragons, the story of the giants is a tragic one that echoes this whole range of fantasy and myth. Begotten by the mighty god Annam, who intended them to rule the worlds with wisdom as well as might, giants have fallen far short of the lofty destiny their progenitor imagined for them. Now supplanted by myriad smaller peoples of the worlds, giants live apart in remote steadings, undersea palaces, subterranean realms, and flying citadels.

*Bigby Presents: Glory of the Giants* explores giants' role in D&D and their realms across the worlds. It delves into the history of the giants and details the places where they live in isolation, as well as the ruins they left behind in their decline. Our guide in this exploration is the wizard Bigby, a former apprentice of Mordenkainen and creator of the spell *Bigby's hand*. Though he began his career determined to use magic to dominate and control others, he eventually changed his ways and has worked hard to make amends for his past villainy. One factor that influenced his change of heart was Bigby's recurring encounters with Diancastra, a demigod revered by many giants. Throughout this book, we see glimpses into the relationship between these two mighty figures of legend.

This introduction presents a portion of the saga of Diancastra. The saga is a window into important aspects of giants' life and thought, and it introduces themes that reappear throughout the book: Annam's retreat from his children, the giants' fall from grace, and the hope some giants hold for a future restoration of their ancient glory.

*Chapter 1* introduces giant-themed options for adventurers, including a subclass that allows characters to tap into the magic of giants (the Path of the Giant barbarian), two giant-related backgrounds (the giant foundling and the rune carver), and a wide selection of feats. The chapter also includes roleplaying suggestions to help you connect a character of any class to the grandeur of giants.

*Chapter 2* offers advice and tables to help Dungeon Masters use giants in play. It covers roleplaying tips, an overview of the hierarchical structure of the ordning and giants' religion, and ideas about giants' organizations and societies.

*Chapter 3* presents tools to help Dungeon Masters build encounters, adventures, and whole campaigns around giants. The chapter includes tables you can use to populate the giants' enclaves presented in chapter 4.

*Chapter 4* discusses the places where giants dwell: the remote enclaves and secret hideaways where they cling to the remnants of their ancient glory. Maps are a centerpiece of the chapter, presenting a range of sites steeped in giants' supernatural power that you can drop into any campaign.

*Chapter 5* details the treasures characters might find as they deal with giants or explore giants' hidden realms. These treasures range from the contents of a wandering giant's bag to the mightiest relics of giants' ancient civilization. The chapter includes more than two dozen new magic items.

*Chapter 6* provides stat blocks and lore for a tremendous variety of giants. The chapter includes new giant kinds (such as the *death giant*) and new variations on the giants found in the *Monster Manual*. A range of other enormous creatures, from towering dinosaurs to magical giant geese, can help DMs populate a giant-sized environment.

*Dear reader,*

*This book represents a journey for me, and I am excited to take your hand and lead you along the same path. I never had much interest in giants, though I certainly respected their strength. My various encounters with Diancastra—who is no less than a daughter of Annam, the All-Father of the giants!—opened my eyes to the glories, the deep magic, and the wisdom of these ancient people.*

*I've asked Diancastra to review this text, and her notes appear throughout the book where her perspective can enlarge upon my own. I trust that her insight and my erudition will expand your horizons as she has broadened mine.*— Bigby![](img/book/BGG/000-00-001.bigby.webp)

## Annam and the Giants

The saga of the demigod Diancastra is an epic poem treasured by skalds and storytellers among all kinds of giants. The portion of the saga excerpted at the start of this book is among its most popular scenes, describing how Diancastra convinced her father to imbue her with divinity even though her mother was a mortal giant.

The story is unusual among the sagas of the giants in its description of Annam's deeds "in time's dawning." It boldly claims Annam collected the fragments of the First World—the original world of the Material Plane, created by the primordial dragons Bahamut and Tiamat—and contributed in some way to their transformation into the Material Plane as it exists today with its myriad worlds. Other sagas claim Annam was similarly instrumental in the creation of the Inner Planes, slowly sorting the tumult of the Elemental Chaos until the four Elemental Planes took shape. These sagas explain the giants' close ties to the elemental forces of air, earth, fire, and water by pointing to Annam's early efforts in the Elemental Planes.

*Diancastra's Saga* also summarizes the central tragedy of giantkind's long history: Annam intended the giants to rule over all the worlds of the Material Plane, but his six sons—the gods Stronmaus, Memnor, Surtur, Thrym, Skoraeus, and Grolantor—failed to live up to their father's expectations for them. (Diancastra calls her brothers "boorish and bumbling." Notably, Annam does not refute her on that point.) Annam's disappointment in his sons caused him to retreat to a hidden realm within the Outlands, far removed from the Material Plane and the domains of other gods.

A key moment in *Diancastra's Saga* is Annam's challenge to his daughter. He dismisses her deeds as "pranks and rebellion" and defies Diancastra to bring him "pure perfection," some item that for all his craft and skill he is unable to improve. He clearly intends this to be an impossible task.

But Diancastra surprises him. Journeying to the outermost reaches of the Elemental Chaos, where unshaped elements form a tumult of matter and energy, she claims a mote of raw chaos and brings it to her father. Annam quickly shapes it, but he is unsatisfied with the result; he shapes it again and again, but—as Diancastra points out—each of his efforts to craft something from the chaos ends up reducing its raw potential into mere actuality.

The saga makes a point that concerns more than Diancastra's cleverness. In granting his daughter's request for divinity, Annam acknowledges that the same chaotic, changeable potential exists within his sons and their descendants. Ultimately, this acknowledgment holds out the possibility that Annam's faith in his descendants might be restored and the All-Father might one day be drawn from his self-imposed exile. That glimmer of hope, faint as it might be, is a significant motivation for those giants who hope to reclaim their people's ancient glory, and it might account for the saga's popularity among giants of all kinds.

*A good saga, well-told, reveals a great deal about the teller. If you're lucky and self-aware, it can also show you something about yourself. Only rarely does it tell you much worth knowing about its subject among its alliteration and kennings and such. That said, Bigby presented me with several versions of my saga, and I insisted he use this one. The interpretation he presents here is a reasonable one.*— Diancastra
### Giantkind

The descendants of Annam are the various creatures of the Giant creature type. The precise details of genealogy linking Annam to these Giants are a matter of mythology, and myths vary from world to world and from one teller to another. Most tellings make a distinction between the main families of giants who are descended from the sons of Annam and the various other creatures whose origins are murkier.

#### Heirs of Annam

As described in the *Monster Manual*, the ordning ranks the six main families of giants. Each family's place in the ordning corresponds to the birth order of the associated son of Annam: Stronmaus, Annam's firstborn, is regarded as the progenitor of storm giants, and Grolantor, progenitor of hill giants, is Annam's youngest son. Thus, the ordning neatly encompasses and arranges **storm giants**, **cloud giants**, **fire giants**, **frost giants**, **stone giants**, and **hill giants** by connecting them to Stronmaus, Memnor, Surtur, Thrym, Skoraeus, and Grolantor, respectively.

That neat structure overlooks the daughters of Annam: Hiatea, Iallanis, and Diancastra. Indeed, these goddesses and their worshipers often push against the boundaries of the ordning, both within each kind of giant and in the overall rankings of the giant families. No giants count the goddesses as ancestors, but that helps ensure their popularity extends across giantkind.

***Fomorians.*** The structure of the ordning also overlooks the **fomorians** and their progenitor, Karontor, who is usually described as Grolantor's older twin. Just as Annam banished Karontor from the family of the gods for his part in inciting the fomorians to assault the Feywild, the All-Father also excluded the fomorians from the ordning.

***Death Giants.*** Once cloud giants, death giants (introduced in *chapter 6* of this book) technically have the same rank in the ordning as the other descendants of Memnor. However, by turning away from the gods of their ancestors to serve the Raven Queen, they have abdicated their place in the ordning.

>The Many Meanings of "Giant"
>
>The word "giant" has multiple meanings in English and in the rules of D&D, opening the possibility of some confusion.
>
>As a rule, when this book talks about "giants," it refers to the various creatures that include "giant" in their name—specifically, the giants found in the *Monster Manual*—**cloud giants**, **fire giants**, **frost giants**, **hill giants**, **stone giants**, and **storm giants**—as well as the death giants that appear in *chapter 6* of this book. These giants are the focus of this book, so it's safe to assume that's what is meant when you see the word "giant" and it's not capitalized or otherwise qualified.
>
>"Giant" is also a creature type in the D&D rules, and as such, it's capitalized whenever it's used. This book usually refers to "creatures of the Giant type" to make sure it's very clear what is being talked about. All the giants are creatures of the Giant type, as are **cyclopes**, **ettins**, **fomorians**, **ogres**, and **trolls**. But that latter group of creatures is not the focus of this book.
>
>"Giant" (capitalized) is also the name of the language spoken by most creatures of the Giant type (as well as a few other creatures, such as hags). References to the language throughout this book typically refer to "the Giant language" or "Giant runes," so there should be no confusion between the language and the creature type.
>

#### Other Giants

The other creatures of the Giant type, who are not included in the category of "giants," are connected to Annam but not descended from him.

***Trolls and Ogres.*** The monstrous god Vaprak is connected to Annam in some myths, though he is never regarded as a proper son of Annam. The Dwarvish Saga of Gnarldan Steelshield describes how Vaprak arose from Annam's blood when it was spilled on one of the worlds he tended, and the **trolls** in turn arose from Vaprak's blood shed in a similar manner. The fensirs introduced in *chapter 6* of this book are descended from trolls. **Ogres** are sometimes described as descendants of Vaprak, giving them a distant and distorted connection to Annam. **Oni** are often said to be distantly related to ogres, but at this point they are more fiendish than Giant.

***Cyclopes.*** Contradictory legends explain the origin of **cyclopes**, and none of those legends are told by cyclopes themselves (who generally display little interest in the question of their origins and their connection to the gods). Some myths lump them in with ogres as descendants of Vaprak, while others claim they were once ogres who joined the ancient fomorians' invasion of the Feywild and thus shared in fomorians' banishment to the Underdark and the resulting corruption of their physical forms. One myth suggests cyclopes are descendants of Karontor like the fomorians, but stemming from a line that began after Karontor's banishment rather than before it.

***Ettins.*** A widespread folktale suggests **ettins** were once orcs who were transformed into their giant-like form by a blessing of the demon lord Demogorgon. If that were true, though, ettins would have no connection to Annam and couldn't be considered kin of the giants. Most giants acknowledge ettins as distant relatives and consider them descendants of Grolantor (and thus distant cousins of hill giants) or of hill giants who were transformed by Demogorgon.

#### Goliaths and Firbolgs

In addition to all these creatures classed as Giants, two Humanoid kinds also claim distant kinship to Annam's heirs. *Goliaths* and *firbolgs* appear in *chapter 6* of this book and also appear as character races in *Mordenkainen Presents: Monsters of the Multiverse*. Their connection to Annam is undoubtedly distant, but some individuals among both peoples hold giants in high regard and even worship the divine children of Annam—especially his daughters.

### Giants of Many Worlds

The saga of Diancastra hints that giants' presence throughout myriad worlds of the Material Plane might be attributable to Annam's role in the shaping of those worlds. Giants believe they were meant to rule the worlds of the Material Plane, and on many worlds, historical records show they once did. But their glory days are in the inconceivably ancient past, long before any smaller folk ever dreamed of writing histories.

#### Forgotten Realms

The origins of the giants on the world of Toril lie far in the past, long before any Humanoid peoples proliferated. According to the giants' sagas, Annam fathered the first giants and guided his sons in establishing an empire called Ostoria. In the sagas, this age is called the Time of Giants.

The age is also called the Time of Dragons, because dragons arose and flourished in the same period. Some say the giants were able to build Ostoria only because conflict among the dragons left power vacuums the giants filled.

After four millennia of coexistence and intermittent conflict, a mighty red dragon named Garyx—sometimes seen as a god among dragons—goaded the dragons into war with the giants of Ostoria. The conflict is remembered as the Thousand-Year War, though it almost certainly involved long periods of quiet interrupted by battles of intense savagery and widespread destruction. By the end of this conflict, Ostoria was reduced to a shadow of its former glory—and Annam turned his back on his descendants in disappointment.

For nearly thirty thousand years since the fall of Ostoria, giants have largely lived in seclusion, keeping as far as possible from the spread of smaller peoples' settlements. From time to time, giants lent their strength to conflicts among other folk. Charismatic giants occasionally forged short-lived kingdoms in ultimately futile efforts to restore the glory of Ostoria, but giants have never again been a driving force in the history of the world as they were during the Dawn Ages.

![The Sword Coast of the Forgotten Realms holds many giant-built ruins featuring massive stone monoliths with keyhole-like openings](img/book/BGG/001-00-002.sword-coast-ruins.webp)

#### Greyhawk

If the giants of Oerth had a mighty empire founded by Annam in the distant past, that fact is not recorded in any of the extant histories of the world. Even so, many giants of Greyhawk revere the sons of Annam, though others have been lured into the service of demon lords or various elder evils.

#### Dragonlance

During the Age of Dreams, the newly created peoples of Krynn awoke to the first dawn of the world. The first to awaken were a Giant folk known as irda, whose myths claimed they were shaped by the hands of the gods. (Some interpreters of these myths identify the dragon queen Takhisis as their creator, while giant scholars on other worlds believe Annam must have had a part in their creation.) The irda quickly established the first mighty nation of the young world, subjugating humans as their empire grew. The irda ruled for thousands of years, but they fell into decadent cruelty and their empire gradually declined until their human servitors overthrew them.

#### Eberron

From the ashes of a mythic war between angelic and demonic forces that left the primeval world in ruins, an empire of giants was born on the mysterious continent of Xen'drik. The giants dominated Xen'drik for millennia, ruling over many smaller peoples—including elves who chafed under their rule. When the might of the giants began to wane, the elves rebelled. As the giants prepared to use world-shattering magic to smite the elves, the dragons of far-off Argonnessen attacked Xen'drik and brought about the fall of the giants' civilization.

Some giants still live among the ruins of their ancient civilization, though both their numbers and their sophistication are greatly diminished since the fall of their empire. Other giants left Xen'drik and now live alongside smaller peoples. Giants have been known to study in the universities of the Five Nations, to lead bands of marauders in Droaam, and to trade with dwarf miners far beneath the surface of the Mror Holds.

The giants of Eberron do not tell legends of Annam the All-Father, nor do they adhere to the rigid structure of the ordning. This might be another example of the effects of Eberron's isolation from the rest of the multiverse, but it is also possible that Annam abandoned his children at the fall of their ancient empire, just as he did on other worlds, and they have since forgotten him entirely.

>Giant Runes and Dwarvish Script
>
>When Annam created the giants, he also taught them language and gave them runes of power. These symbols are pictographs: each symbol represents a whole word or concept rather than a single letter or sound. Each rune holds latent magical power, much like the glyphs inscribed in magic circles of protection, teleportation circles, and magical traps like the *glyph of warding* spell. Thus, the first giants treated these runes as a sacred secret and rarely wrote them.
>
>It wasn't until long after the first flourishing of the giants' culture that the introduction of the Dwarvish script—an alphabetic set of symbols, where each glyph represents a single sound—made transcribing the Giant language an easier task. To this day, most written forms of the Giant language use the *Dwarvish script* (as described in the *Player's Handbook*), and the knowledge of Giant runes is rare except among those who study magical writing.

# Chapter 1: Character Creation

*One of my first encounters with giants was also the last thing I did at my old friend (and former foe) Mordenkainen's side. He claims to this day that no cleric was available to restore me to life, only a druid, but he can't hide his smirk when he says it.*— BigbyMost adventurers have heard tales of giants and their ilk. But for some adventurers, their connection to giants runs deeper than fanciful stories.

This chapter is for any D&D character who aspires to forge a link to the mighty giants. From sources of havoc-wreaking power to the artful study of rune magic, from boons that imbue an individual with giant-like might to fantastic tales that can shape an adventurer's entire life—giants can make both big and small impacts on a character's story.

The following sections present a variety of options for creating characters with ties to giants:

"*Subclass Option*" allows barbarians to explore ties to the nature of giants.

"*Backgrounds*" presents two new backgrounds: the giant foundling and the rune carver. These backgrounds represent formative years spent studying and living among giants, and they grant access to feats that represent that experience.

"*Big Heroes, Big Stories*" includes inspiration for narratively connecting characters to giants, regardless of their class or background.

"*Feats*" provides options for players who wish to link their characters to giants and primordial magic.

![](img/book/BGG/022-01-001.bigby-squish.webp)

## Subclass Option

This section presents one new subclass option: the Path of the Giant for the barbarian.

![Halfling Path of the Giant Barbarian](img/book/BGG/023-01-002.halfling-barbarian.webp)

## Backgrounds

This section presents two backgrounds that provide options linking characters to the ancient magic of giants. The giant foundling background represents a life spent around titanic creatures and their supernatural might. The rune carver background reflects a history of studying the ancient traditions of giants' runecraft.

### Bonus Feats

If the DM decides to allow the giant foundling and rune carver backgrounds, all characters in the campaign gain access to a bonus feat. If you select one of those backgrounds, you gain the bonus feat specified in that background. If the background you choose doesn't provide a feat, you gain a bonus feat of your choice from the following list (these feats appear in the *Player's Handbook*):

- Skilled
- Tough

## Big Heroes, Big Stories

The remnants of giants' power, ancient and strong, echo throughout the worlds, touching the lives of individuals regardless of their background. This section provides various ways to narratively tie your character to the myth and might of giants.

### Heroes of the Giants

Barbarians who harness the might of giants are not the only adventurers who draw power from giants. A character of any class can explore ties to giants in the following ways.

#### Elements and Environments

If your spells or class features draw on elemental forces or the magic of the land, you might use a connection to giants to tap into that power. A druid belonging to the Circle of the Land might feel a connection to the giants who inhabit that land. A monk who follows the Way of the Four Elements might seek to emulate Annam, the All-Father, to shape and channel the forces of the Elemental Chaos.

#### Giant Ancestors

You might be distantly descended from giants and manifest the power of your ancestors in your class features or magic, which might explain your Rage as a barbarian or your spellcasting as a sorcerer.

#### Giant Foes

Your character's relationship to giants might be defined by animosity. You could choose class features specifically to target giants or all creatures with the Giant type, or you could write enmity toward giants into the tenets of your paladin's Sacred Oath.

#### Giant Lore

You might have learned magic, martial techniques, or other secrets from studying giants, either ancient or living. Your character might strive to unearth and record more of the ancient history of giants or to learn more of their present ways. This could be a matter of personal motivation, but it also might explain some of your class features or magic. A bard of the College of Lore might focus on the study of giants, a Rune Knight fighter (from *Tasha's Cauldron of Everything*) might use the magic of Giant runes, or a paladin's Sacred Oath could involve allegiance to the tenets of a philosophy or organization of giants (such as those described in *chapter 2*).

#### Giant-Made Accessories

You might use a giant-crafted item—probably something inscribed with one or more Giant runes—as a spellcasting focus. For example, the staff you wield as an arcane focus might have been a giant's wand. Your wizard's spellbook might be a relic from an ancient realm of giants, perhaps a large and heavy tome mostly written in the Giant language. Or you might wield a weapon that a giant intended for a different use, such as a giant's letter opener that works as a sword or a giant's hatchet that serves you as a greataxe. Perhaps you have learned to play a giant's violin as if it were a cello or use a musical instrument made for a giant child.

#### Gods of the Giants

Your character might worship one of the gods described in *chapter 2*. If you were reared by giants, they might have taught you their faith. Perhaps one of those gods called you to fulfill a specific purpose. Alternatively, you could worship one of the so-called "interloper gods" (also described in *chapter 2*) who often take an interest in giants, or one of those entities might be your warlock's Otherworldly Patron.

#### Mentors and Patrons

Perhaps you had a giant as a mentor or a financial benefactor who taught you your profession or your class or provided you with your starting equipment. If you have a continuing obligation to this giant, see "*Giant Patrons*" in *chapter 3* for additional inspiration.

#### Primeval Animals

You could have a connection with giant-sized or prehistoric animals. You might call on the spirits of cave bears, dire wolves, or eagle-eyed pteranodons, or you might use your magic to take the shapes of such creatures. Or you could have a dinosaur companion.

![A druid summons a primeval beast](img/book/BGG/026-01-005.druid-primeval.webp)

### Birthplaces and Hometowns

Your character might hail from a location steeped in giants' history and primordial magic. From ancient ruins to underground caverns to elemental nexuses, this section provides various locales to tie to your character's backstory.

#### Ancient Giant Ruins

You grew up amid the ruins of one of the giants' civilizations. Perhaps the history of your home settlement is well-known, with lauded scholars traveling to the site to conduct archaeological research. Or maybe its origins are a mystery, your only clues being the strange, oversized objects occasionally found in the nearby land.

***Giant Trinket.*** While exploring your home, you discovered some trivial remnant of the ancient inhabitants, as determined by rolling on the *Giant Trinkets* table. The items in parentheses are the normal-sized objects most analogous to the described giant trinkets.

![A character raised in the ruins of giant civilization uses giant-made tools](img/book/BGG/027-01-006.character-giant-teacup.webp)

#### Primordial Nexus

You grew up surrounded by powerful elemental magic. Maybe you lived in a place where the border between the Material Plane and an Elemental Plane was thin. Or perhaps you spent your formative years traversing the Elemental Planes as a merchant or scholar, visiting fantastic locations such as the City of Brass on the Plane of Fire or the Labyrinth Winds of the Plane of Air.

In any case, your time spent among these elemental forces deeply affected you. The Material Plane feels mundane and controlled, especially when you have experienced firsthand the churning chaos of the primordial elements.

***Elemental Mark.*** Your exposure to primordial elemental magic has altered you physically in some small way, determined by rolling on the Elemental Marks table.

##### Elemental Marks

You spent your formative years deep beneath the ground, sequestered far from the sun and wind of the surface.

You may have encountered giants during your time underground—particularly families of gentle stone giants or talented smithing guilds of fire giants. To you, the surface world is just a long-forgotten memory or distant dream.

### Tall Tales

Some folks are content to merely listen to stories of giants and other enormous peoples and creatures. For others, these tall tales become the basis of their entire adventuring career. Such individuals find themselves gripped by legends of giants, spurred to embark on dangerous quests in search of truth or vindication.

Myths about giants vary across the worlds. The Tall Tales table provides ideas for legends of—or encounters with—giant creatures that may have inspired your character to begin adventuring.

# Chapter 2: Giants in Play

*New body, new adventures! The first time I encountered Diancastra was in the dungeons beneath the hill giant lord's hall. I thought her an ordinary prisoner and helped her escape. In return, she taught me the rudiments of rune carving.*— BigbyIntended for the Dungeon Master, this chapter explores key aspects of giants' life and society. The ideas and tables included here should inspire you as you prepare to use giants in your D&D game. This material is divided into five main sections:

"*Roleplaying Giants*" discusses how to bring giants to life during your game.

"*The Ordning*" explores the relationships among and within different giant kinds, with a focus on the ordning's role in driving adventures.

"*Gods and Religion*" describes a pantheon of gods consisting of Annam the All-Father and his children. It also discusses various "interlopers" that vie for the worship of giants in Annam's absence.

"*Social Structures*" explores various models of giant societies and the relationships between giants and other kinds of creatures.

"*Organizations*" details organizations that unite giants across the lines of the ordning, bringing them together around common goals and beliefs.

As with the rest of this book, this chapter focuses on the main families of giants described in the *Monster Manual*, but much of this advice can also be applied to other creatures of the Giant type.

## Roleplaying Giants

Apart from their size, giants are much like humans—which is to say that they're tremendously diverse and hard to generalize about. When creating a giant for your campaign, you can use the tables for *designing NPCs* in the *Dungeon Master's Guide* to help you make the giant a distinctive character. Just like a Humanoid NPC, a giant with an unusual tattoo, a propensity for punning, or a knack for juggling becomes more vivid in your players' imaginations.

When creating giant characters or roleplaying giants, remember these key elements: size, age, volume, and pride. This section describes traits and behaviors you can incorporate into your portrayal of giants to emphasize each of these elements, and offers example names for each kind of giant.

### Size

The giants of the ordning are enormous, ranging from 16 to 26 feet tall. The size relationship between a giant and a human is roughly comparable to that between an adult human and a newborn human baby. A giant might think of Humanoids as akin to helpless babies, adorable pets (like small dogs), disgusting vermin (like large rats), or toy soldiers.

Consider how you can convey a sense of a giant's size as you play the giant. You might stand above seated players to loom over them or describe behaviors that emphasize the giant's size. The Huge Behaviors table gives examples of habits and events that can communicate a giant's enormous scale.

##### Huge Behaviors
|  d8 | Behavior                                                                                                                  |
|:---:|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|  1  | The giant has a pet (a **panther**, a **wolf**, or a **giant weasel**) that sits on the giant's lap or shoulder.          |
|  2  | The giant swats at a murmuration of starlings as if it were a cloud of gnats.                                             |
|  3  | The giant uses a *dagger* as a toothpick, a *greatsword* as a letter opener, or a pair of *javelins* as knitting needles. |
|  4  | The giant carefully lifts Humanoids (cradling their heads to avoid injury) to see and hear them better.                   |
|  5  | The giant exclaims with admiration at the fine detail and exquisite articulation of the characters' armor.                |
|  6  | The giant fidgets with the skulls of Humanoids.                                                                           |
|  7  | The giant drinks from a barrel as a human would from a waterskin.                                                         |
|  8  | The giant takes a messy bite from a large melon held in one hand.                                                         |

![A huge melon in a human's hands is a snacking fruit in a stone giant's](img/book/BGG/030-02-002.lounging-giant.webp)

### Age

Giants are long-lived compared to humans, though not as much as their semidivine ancestors. Their life spans generally correspond with their place in the ordning, with hill giants living about two centuries and storm giants as many as six. Stone giants are the exception, sometimes reaching over eight hundred years of age, as enduring as the stone for which they're named. The Life Spans table shows the average life span of each kind of giant within the ordning. (Other creatures of the Giant type live about as long as humans, on average.)

In keeping with their long life spans, giants tend to live their lives at a slower pace than smaller folk. They often speak slowly and avoid rushing into decisions. Adding potential confusion to their interactions with smaller races, giants are often comically out of touch with happenings in the wider world, keeping a store of knowledge about Humanoid realms and peoples that was already outdated when they learned it as children. The Ancient Behaviors table suggests some ways you can communicate a giant's age in an encounter.

##### Life Spans
| Giant Kind | Life Span |
|------------|-----------|
| Hill       | 200 years |
| Frost      | 250 years |
| Fire       | 350 years |
| Cloud      | 400 years |
| Storm      | 600 years |
| Stone      | 800 years |

##### Ancient Behaviors
|  d8 | Behavior                                                                                                                    |
|:---:|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|  1  | The giant addresses Humanoids as citizens of a fallen realm (equivalent to calling people in the real world "Babylonians"). |
|  2  | The giant burdens conversation with irrelevant historical context.                                                          |
|  3  | The giant is curious about minute details of fashion, slang, and popular culture among Humanoids.                           |
|  4  | The giant is a hopeless procrastinator, always convinced there will be time later for any task.                             |
|  5  | The giant is prone to reminiscing about friends and family members who have died.                                           |
|  6  | The giant is unwilling to accept any problems as truly urgent.                                                              |
|  7  | The giant is determined to wring every possible ounce of enjoyment from each day.                                           |
|  8  | The giant is convinced that giants were meant to use their long lives to make a mark on the world.                          |

### Volume

Giants are loud. From the earth-shaking rumble of several-ton footsteps to ear-splitting roars supported by lungs the size of barrels, giants can make a lot of noise. Don't yell at your players, but consider raising your voice a little, and perhaps gently shaking the table to demonstrate how the earth trembles at the giant's footsteps. Finding ways to emphasize a giant's volume can help everyone at the table appreciate the scale of the encounter. The Loud Behaviors table offers more suggestions.

##### Loud Behaviors
|  d6 | Behavior                                                                                                   |
|:---:|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|  1  | The giant constantly (and loudly) encourages smaller creatures to speak up.                                |
|  2  | The giant's thoughtful "hmm" causes a rumbling vibration in the ground and the pit of listeners' stomachs. |
|  3  | The giant's exclamation of surprise or anger briefly sets listeners' ears ringing.                         |
|  4  | The giant's sneeze, snore, or sigh rattles windows or blows leaves off trees.                              |
|  5  | The giant's laughter feels like a small earthquake.                                                        |
|  6  | The giant's armor or weapons clang thunderously.                                                           |

### Pride

Many giants are taught that Annam begot the giants and intended them to rule the worlds of the Material Plane. Though giants have learned many hard lessons in the millennia since their origin, a sense of self-importance still pervades their stories and inflates their vanity. It can be hard for a 16- to 26-foot-tall giant to take 3- to 7-foot-tall Humanoids and their concerns seriously. Use the Proud Behaviors table to inspire your portrayal of giants' pride and vanity.

##### Proud Behaviors
|  d8 | Behavior                                                                                                                                           |
|:---:|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|  1  | The giant ignores smaller creatures unless they offer the giant obeisance and flattery.                                                            |
|  2  | The giant refuses to bend over, sit, or kneel in the presence of smaller creatures.                                                                |
|  3  | The giant ignores the names of smaller creatures, referring to them with generic labels (such as "human" or "armor shaker").                       |
|  4  | The giant's first reaction to smaller creatures—even when threatened or presented with a terrible problem—is laughter.                             |
|  5  | The giant constantly demeans or patronizes smaller creatures, calling them "tiny," "insignificant," "babies," "pests," "vermin," or similar terms. |
|  6  | The giant won't speak any language but Giant.                                                                                                      |
|  7  | The giant erupts in rage at the slightest sign of insult or disrespect from a smaller creature.                                                    |
|  8  | The giant addresses smaller creatures in a tone that drips with condescension and refuses to take them seriously.                                  |

### Names

If you need a name for a giant, use the Giants' Names table and freely combine or change names as you wish. You can also use a name that doesn't match the giant's kind, which might reflect, for example, a hill giant with lofty aspirations or a stone giant raised among frost giants.

## The Ordning

As described in the *Monster Manual*, the giants of many worlds organize themselves in a complex social ranking called the ordning. At the largest scale, the ordning establishes the relative positions of the six main kinds of giants, with **storm giants** at the top, followed (in order) by **cloud giants**, **fire giants**, **frost giants**, and **stone giants**, with **hill giants** at the bottom. Other creatures of the Giant type—such as **ettins**, **fomorians**, and **trolls**—are not counted as part of the ordning, placing them functionally below the hill giants.

At a smaller scale, every giant has a precise place within the larger framework of the ordning, and each kind of giant has a different way of assigning that place. Cloud giants rank themselves based on wealth, fire giants based on crafting skill, frost giants based on physical strength, and stone giants based on a combination of artistry and rock throwing. Hill giants give their respect to larger and stronger giants without putting much thought into hierarchical ranks. Only storm giants, largely solitary and imagining themselves above such petty concerns, have no interest in ranking themselves. Regardless of a giant's ranking within its kind, no giant can transcend the ordning of the six giant kinds; the most accomplished fire giant artisan ranks below the poorest cloud giant, for example.

For any given giant (except a storm giant), you can use the Giants and the Ordning table to determine the giant's place within the ranking of that particular giant kind, and the giant's attitude toward that place. Four more tables provide suggestions for how a cloud, fire, frost, or stone giant's efforts to retain or achieve a high status within the ordning might drive adventures. (Hill and storm giants aren't included here because of their limited participation in the ordning.)

*The ordning strikes me as something between a god-ordained hierarchy and a true meritocracy.*— Bigby

|  2  | A cloud giant hosts an art gala in a cloud castle to display their wealth, providing an opportunity for the characters to retrieve an important magic item from the giant's collection.                    |
|  3  | Wishing to one-up rivals, a cloud giant seeks adventurers to hunt exotic monsters for a lavish banquet.                                                                                                    |
|  4  | With two nations on the brink of war, the characters discover cloud giants are betting on the outcome—and at least one giant is meddling behind the scenes to increase the likelihood of one side winning. |
|  5  | A cloud giant who recently lost a large amount of money on bad bets tries to recoup those losses by plundering a royal treasury or the adventurers' stronghold.                                            |
|  6  | A cloud giant offers to buy the adventurers' services as an extravagant (and useful) gift for another giant.                                                                                               |

### Rejecting the Ordning

Some giants reject the ordning, in part or entirely. This rejection most commonly takes one of three forms.

First are giants who hold themselves to a different standard than the one their kind traditionally values. These are often giants whose ranking within their kind is low. For example, a contemplative cloud giant might pursue knowledge rather than wealth, or a weak frost giant might trade in secrets and blackmail to hold onto some measure of power. These giants might avoid the company of their own kind to escape the expectations and customs attached to the ordning. In addition, devotees of Annam's daughters—Hiatea, Iallanis, and Diancastra—tend to push against the strict definitions of the ordning as a matter of principle.

Second, a few giants take a revolutionary stance meant to upset the ordning. A mighty frost giant warrior, not content to rule only frost giants and lesser creatures, could attempt to subjugate fire or cloud giants. Such revolutionaries often aim to impose their own kind's understanding of the ordning on all kinds of giants, so a master artisan among the fire giants might attempt to claim a higher place than storm giants who lack the same crafting skill. These efforts rarely have any lasting impact, but some have managed to upset the ordning at a local level for a few centuries. Because their sense of the ordning relies on physical power and military strength, frost giants are the most likely to impose their standards on other giants. Along similar lines, sometimes giants measure themselves by the standards of a different kind of giant and try to break from the ordning by exceeding those standards. A strong stone giant, for example, might try to claim a place within the frost giants' ordning.

Third, giants who turn from the worship of Annam's children to other powers (as described under "*Gods and Religion*" later in this chapter) also reject the ordning. In some cases, as in the hierarchical cults of Elemental Evil, the new religion replaces the giants' ordning with a different structure that offers the same sense of order, purpose, and meaning. Such cults place giants at a higher position than the giants would otherwise enjoy in the ordning.

When giants join the cults of demon lords, they reject the entire concept of the ordning—the idea that there is any kind of order to the multiverse at all, which is the literal meaning of the word *ordning* in the Giant tongue. These giants reject meaning, status, and hierarchy in favor of chaos and destruction.

The Rejecting the Ordning table offers adventure hooks inspired by these ideas, illustrating how giants' attitudes toward the ordning can impact characters and the lives of Humanoids who live near them.

### Origin of the Ordning

Most giants believe Annam established the ordning at the very beginning and that it reflects the birth order of his sons. One myth likens the ordning to the structure of the mountains: from lowly foothills (**hill giants**), up to the stone of the mountain (**stone giants**), the snow on the peaks (**frost giants**), the lava spewing from the peak of a volcano (**fire giants**), and then above the peak to the clouds (**cloud giants**) and the storm (**storm giants**). These myths depict the ordning as an inherent part of what it means to be a giant, as natural as the geography of the land.

Sagas told among giants on some worlds suggest other explanations for the ordning, linking it to the giants' fall from Annam's good graces. In some of these stories, the ordning isn't natural at all; it's part of the giants' fall—an invention of Annam's sons and a distortion of Annam's will for them. In other stories, it is a consequence of their fall—a punishment Annam inflicted on the giants after they proved themselves incapable of governing the world. The ordning might be necessary, or a burden giants are expected to bear, but giants who hold these views often look forward to Annam abolishing the ordning in some mythic future.

Giants on some worlds (including Eberron) have no concept of the ordning at all. Such giants might think of themselves as a single species, with the differences among giant kinds reflecting a cultural or geographical distinction rather than an inherent one. They might live in bands composed of multiple giant kinds or family groups of a single kind. Or giants of different kinds might not recognize each other as kindred at all. All these giants build a range of social structures in the same manifold ways other peoples do, without regard to an overarching ordning.

## Gods and Religion

The myths of giants across the Material Plane differ in many details, but most of them portray giants as descendants of a progenitor god, typically Annam, the All-Father. Giants believe they are nearly divine, and they are inclined to view their existence as part of a mythic story that is still unfolding. Unlike some other powerful, ancient creatures (such as dragons), giants don't typically exalt themselves and demand worship from lesser beings. Rather, they are often drawn to follow gods—and sometimes other powerful beings—who help them live out their part in that epic saga.

### Annam and the Ordning

Most giants revere a pantheon of gods comprising Annam and his divine children—a pantheon they call "the Ordning" because it is the archetype of the ordning that structures giant society. The head of the pantheon is the All-Father, but most giants view him as a remote, disinterested, or deeply disappointed father who has little role to play in giant life any more. The other ten gods, generally recognized as his children, are more important in most giants' view. The Gods of the Ordning table summarizes key information about these gods.

#### Annam

Annam is a complicated figure, depicted in a variety of ways in myths told across countless worlds of the Material Plane. These stories have been altered in the telling over the course of thousands of years. In some myths, he is the creator of worlds, and other gods merely populated the worlds Annam made with peoples of their own creation. Such myths often describe an ancient era when giants were the only people inhabiting the worlds, or giants shared the worlds with dragons. In other myths, Annam worked with other gods to create worlds together. *Diancastra's Saga*, told in part in the *introduction* to this book, describes Annam gathering the shattered fragments of the First World (the original creation of Bahamut and Tiamat) and spreading them across the Material Plane to create countless worlds. Still other myths describe Annam as a sleeping god whose dreams formed the substance of reality and allowed other gods to create within it.

Annam is often described as an all-knowing god whose deep learning, profound meditations, and expansive philosophy offer endless wisdom for his descendants to study. Occasionally, he's more of a trickster figure whose escapades across the worlds are greeted with uproarious laughter and serve as cautionary tales.

Giants on most worlds agree that Annam is no longer active in the affairs of giants in the Material Plane. Some say he despaired over his quarreling children. Others believe he lost hope in his descendants when their ancient empires fell into ruin. Some claim he was weakened after a long battle against his brother, Memnor (who is more commonly described as one of Annam's sons), and was forced to withdraw from the world until he regained his strength. Other dubious tales suggest he fled the Material Plane to escape the consequences of some misadventure.

***Priests and Rites.*** Thanks to his prolonged absence from mortal giants' affairs, Annam has few priests. On some worlds, he has no priests and his name is all but forgotten. On other worlds, a priest of Annam serves as an adviser and mediator to scattered groups of giants, traveling extensively to visit far-flung communities. In some places, priests of Annam are great kings who rule over realms comprising different giant kinds. Even on worlds where Annam's priests are important, many giants (sometimes including his priests) are convinced Annam no longer hears the prayers of his people.

![The Path of the Pilgrim climbs past shrines to each of Annam's children to reach the All-Father's temple](img/book/BGG/032-02-004.path-of-the-pilgrim.webp)

#### Diancastra

Diancastra is the youngest child of Annam, born of a mortal giant mother shortly before Annam retreated from the Material Plane. The saga of her effort to claim her full divine inheritance is a popular tale among giants who value guile and trickery over brute strength or magical might. The tale is also beloved because it offers hope that Annam might emerge from his self-imposed exile if his descendants can restore his faith in them.

*Diancastra's Saga* tells of the demigod boasting to her father of her clever deeds rather than her feats of strength: she solved a sphinx's riddles, plumbed the secrets of the ocean, and stole a string of pearls from a god of the kuo-toa. Through these and many other exploits, she demonstrated not just her giant-sized might but also her bravery (bordering on foolhardiness), her talent for trickery (often aided by magical illusions), and her cleverness. Giants who value or seek to emulate these qualities pray and sacrifice to her, asking her blessing. Those who hold out hope for the restoration of giants' ancient glory worship her as well, imploring her to find her way once more to Annam's secret sanctum and persuade him to end his seclusion.

#### Grolantor

Annam's youngest son and Karontor's younger twin is Grolantor, a brash braggart who takes enormous pride in his great strength (which some would say is his only redeeming quality). Tales of Grolantor's exploits highlight his strength and his insatiable hunger, and most of them end with him in conflict with one of his siblings. To hill giants, these stories make Grolantor a figure to be admired. Among the other giants, Grolantor is the butt of every joke, always coming out poorly in comparison to his siblings. Those giants think he is a selfish boor who has no respect for the ordning, as Grolantor refuses to see why his status should not be equal to that of Stronmaus and his other brothers.

In addition to hill giants, some frost giants admire Grolantor's physical might, and many ogres and ettins revere him as well. Grolantor exemplifies the principle that the strong should take what they want, without regard for the needs of weaker creatures. The ordning holds no meaning for hill giants—who are on the bottom rung—or ogres and ettins, who are even lower. The only social order they recognize is "might makes right."

***Priests and Rites.*** Grolantor's priests often boast of having experienced a personal interaction with their god—a dream, waking vision, or even an encounter with a manifestation of Grolantor. These encounters typically involve the god demanding something he wants from the priests, such as a fresh kill or a precious trinket. His priests then demand (and often take by force) sacrifices for Grolantor from their kin, with a minimum of ritual or prayer involved.

#### Hiatea

Hiatea is Annam's second child, after Stronmaus, and the companionship and friendly rivalry between these two oldest children are the focus of many myths. In these stories, Hiatea is both a protective figure who keeps watch over the hearths and fields of giants, blessing their agriculture and their family lives, and a wild huntress who wields the power of nature as a weapon of destruction as well as a source of bounty. Some myths suggest her mother hid her among firbolgs after her birth, where Hiatea focused on strengthening communities. Then, when she learned of her true parentage, she pursued arduous quests as a hunter and monster slayer to prove her worth to her father. (It's possible that *Diancastra's Saga*, excerpted in the *introduction* to this book, alludes to this story when Annam compares Diancastra's deeds to Hiatea's.) Another myth suggests Stronmaus taunted Hiatea for remaining aloof from a bitter war against dragons, spurring her to prove herself a valiant warrior as well as a champion of peaceful giants.

***Priests and Rites.*** Giants of all kinds offer prayers to Hiatea, ranging from simple blessings at the kindling of a hearth fire to thanksgivings at the conclusion of a successful hunt or harvest. She is the most popular god of the Ordning among goliaths and firbolgs, who claim a distant kinship with giants.

Hiatea's priests adopt one of two roles, reflecting the god's dual areas of concern. Some live within the giants' enclaves and focus their efforts on maintaining the community, tending to agriculture, and educating children. Others patrol the wilderness surrounding the enclave, guarding against threats to the community.

#### Iallanis

Born about the same time as Grolantor, Iallanis is everything her boorish brother is not: kind, loving, merciful, joyful, and thoughtful. She loves every part of the worlds her father made, and she constantly strives to bring not only her divine family but also mortal giants together in harmony. Iallanis envisions a restored giant empire as a realm of benevolence, learning, and innovation where giants lead but do not rule like tyrants.

***Priests and Rites.*** Good-aligned giants who appreciate her ideals pray to Iallanis for peace, unity, and mercy. Her priests often officiate weddings among giants, even evil ones. Stone giants frequently appeal to her as an artistic muse, trusting that her love of beauty will inspire their work.

#### Karontor

Karontor is the elder twin of Grolantor. In a handful of myths, Karontor appears as a wicked schemer whose hatred of his brothers knows no bounds. The fomorians once occupied a place in the ordning corresponding to Karontor's place, but then Karontor incited the fomorians to assault the Feywild. Just as the fomorians were banished into the Underdark, so too did Annam banish Karontor to a subterranean prison.

***Priests and Rites.*** Few dare to worship Karontor, even in secret. Superstitious giants believe if his name is spoken, Karontor might burrow up from the Underdark to drag the hapless speaker underground to an eternity of torture. To avoid uttering his name, giants sometimes refer to him as "the banished son," "the forgotten one," or "the king that crawls." A few cults revere him, beseeching him for sinister magical secrets or to consume their enemies.

#### Memnor

*When it comes to Memnor, the wisest policy is the simplest: don't believe a single thing you read.*— DiancastraMemnor is an ambiguous figure in the mythology of giants, and the tales concerning him are so disparate that it's possible two gods exist with the same name. More likely, the confusion surrounding his nature and identity is a result of his own duplicity. In most myths, Memnor is constantly tricking and infuriating his father, drawing Annam's wrath down on himself and (more often) his brothers. In one myth, Memnor is Annam's sinister twin, constantly challenging his brother for control of the worlds. In this tale, Annam defeated Memnor but was left so weakened by the contest that Annam fled to his private sanctum, leaving his children to govern the affairs of the giants.

Memnor is typically described as clever and persuasive on the one hand, and as sly and manipulative on the other. His brothers often suspect him of trying to usurp Annam's place at the head of the Ordning to rule all the affairs of giantkind. Among mortal giants, the same accusation is often leveled against his priests. But giants who revere him for his charisma and intellect insist he has the welfare of all giants at heart, seeking to restore them to their proper place at the head of all creation.

***Priests and Rites.*** Memnor has wicked priests within his fold who emulate his duplicity, his self-interest, and his manipulative ability to make others do exactly what he wants—usually to their own detriment. These priests often undermine or exploit the ordning to their own benefit. Without careful investigation, it's impossible to separate these villains from the ranks of those priests of Memnor who faithfully serve the ordning, acting as advisers and advocates at every rank of giants' society.

#### Skoraeus

Despite being the fifth of Annam's sons, Skoraeus (called "Stonebones" by his stone giant followers) is depicted as the wisest among them, particularly knowledgeable about magic, wards, hidden treasures, and the secrets of the earth. It is said he gave Surtur the secret of smelting, showed Thrym how to carve magic runes on weapons, and crafted spears for Hiatea so she could complete her tasks of valor. A dour loner, Skoraeus often sits on the sidelines during the schemes and battles of his siblings. He appears in one myth after other as an observer, a confidant to the other gods, and a keeper of secrets.

***Priests and Rites.*** Giants invoke Skoraeus's name when they begin any work of art or craft, particularly stonework, and they often dedicate the final product to his glory. Stone giants pray to Stonebones, the Great Creator, in a much broader range of circumstances, eager for divine insight as they carry out their daily lives. His priests undertake frequent pilgrimages into the Underdark, seeking revelation from Skoraeus in the depths of the earth.

#### Stronmaus

Annam's eldest child is jovial Stronmaus, whose greatest failing in myth is his inability to see the foolishness, jealousy, and outright evil that festers in the souls of his brothers. His boundless energy, sunny optimism, and zest for life pervade the legends that tell of his many mighty deeds. A few tales, though, describe a dramatic change in Stronmaus after his father's withdrawal from the Ordning, which left Stronmaus effectively in charge of the pantheon. Since then, Stronmaus has become brooding, aloof, and melancholy, deeply frustrated with his inability to unite the gods of the Ordning—and hurt by his father's abandonment.

***Priests and Rites.*** All giants acknowledge Stronmaus's place on the throne of the gods in Annam's absence, but to most of them, he is but a steward, an inadequate substitute for the All-Father. They offer the required prayers and sacrifices (a scattering of fragrant herbs and incense on the wind each morning), but their prayers often sound more like a list of grievances than honest worship. His priests are drawn from giants who occupy high positions within the ordning of their kind, including wealthy cloud giants, strong frost giants, and accomplished stone giants. Being a priest of Stronmaus has no effect on a giant's rank in the ordning; instead, it often makes the giant a target of resentment and complaints from other giants.

#### Surtur

Surtur is the elder twin of Thrym, and rivalry has driven the two gods from the moment of their birth. Surtur is generally depicted as the cleverer of the two, often outwitting his brother in contests where Thrym's greater strength might otherwise let him prevail. Their history of competition ranges from striving to outdo each other in childhood accomplishments to bloody battles that ended only when their father or one of their siblings intervened. Other myths describe cunning Surtur leading his brother on dangerous adventures, typically leaving mayhem and destruction in their wake. Aside from his escapades involving Thrym, Surtur is known for his unsurpassed skill at metalwork, especially forging weapons and armor.

***Priests and Rites.*** Giants pray to Surtur in search of creative inspiration and ask his blessing on their smithies. They invoke his name when they light forges, kilns, and ovens. Among fire giants, the worship of Surtur is often tinged with the expectation of a coming battle that will destroy worlds, slay many gods, and upend the ordning, leaving fire giants as the undisputed masters of all creation. Surtur's fire giant priests stoke the flames of this expectation when they address Surtur as "the All-Consuming Flame" or "the Cleansing Fire." Some priests stockpile weapons—ranging from ordinary swords and axes to magical devices of devastating potential—in preparation for this great battle.

#### Thrym

As Surtur's younger twin, Thrym is described in myths as his brother's rival and coconspirator. He is depicted as the stronger and braver of the two, and he often comes out on top in contests and conflicts where those qualities outweigh Surtur's cleverness. Thrym is often described as a bully, frustrated that Annam seemed to favor Surtur; he vents that frustration by harassing his younger brother Skoraeus. Thrym appears in myth as the greatest warrior of the Ordning. He leads bands of mortal giants in raids and skirmishes, bringing glory to giantkind and striking terror into the enemies of Annam's children.

***Priests and Rites.*** Giants sometimes ask Thrym for his blessing before hunting or going to war, and they pour out blood from their kills to thank Thrym for their success. Thrym's priests are war leaders who offer military counsel to the leaders of giant communities.

### Interloper Gods

Annam's withdrawal has caused ongoing upheaval in the religious lives of giants across the Material Plane. Most believe Annam turned from his descendants in anger or disappointment, and many hope he can be convinced to return to his divine throne if the giants restore their ancient glory. But some giants believe that Annam is dead, that he is petulant and unworthy of worship, or that he will never reclaim his throne. Some of these giants look for purpose in the service of other gods or powers. Giants who remain faithful to the gods of the Ordning call these other powers "interloper gods," believing they are trespassing on the territory of Annam's children and intruding into the affairs of giants. A giant who worships these gods violates the ordning; giants' proper place in the multiverse is above such monstrous beings as demon lords, elemental evils, and gods who are not Annam's children, so it is upside-down for a giant to serve these entities. Giants who follow interloper gods are cast out of society if they are discovered, but they believe the benefits of serving those powers outweigh the risk of exile.

#### Vaprak

Some myths suggest Vaprak is a child of Annam and thus properly belongs to the Ordning, but others say he formed from Annam's spilled blood. For a variety of reasons, he is never accorded equal status to the All-Father's other children. Known as the Destroyer, Vaprak is prone to mindless, destructive rampages. The god is described as a greenish creature strongly resembling a troll. Indeed, legend suggests **trolls** formed from Vaprak's blood in the same way he came from Annam's, and many trolls venerate him. Some ogres and giants also worship Vaprak, particularly giants who despair of ever rising in the ordning.

#### Demon Lords

Service to a demon lord is tempting to many giants, particularly those frost and hill giants who value size and strength above all. For these giants, demon worship paradoxically offers both freedom from the strictures of the ordning (and from the notion of a cosmic order more generally), and exactly the kind of power their ordning rewards. Of the countless rulers of the infinite Abyss, four have particular influence among giantkind.

***Baphomet.*** As described in the *Monster Manual*, Baphomet the Horned King encourages his followers to embrace their fundamentally bestial nature. Giants who delight in the frenzy of battle and bloodshed are easily lured to the demon lord's service. Stone giants who feel stifled and repressed by their society sometimes break free in dramatic fashion by embracing Baphomet's creed (see the **stalker of Baphomet** in *chapter 6*).

***Demogorgon.*** Demogorgon has few followers among the giants of the ordning, but ettins often recognize a kindred spirit in the two-headed demon lord. The **echo of Demogorgon** in *chapter 6* is an ettin cultist who has received Demogorgon's hideous gifts.

***Kostchtchie.*** Though he is not terribly important in the Abyss, the demon lord Kostchtchie is revered by many giants, particularly frost giants. Part of his appeal is his willingness (when bribed with bloody offerings) to inspire his worshipers with ferocity and bloodlust. More than any other demon lord, what he offers his followers—raw strength and fury in battle—appeals directly to the values shared by many frost giants, making him appear as an exemplar of the giants' ideals. The **fury of Kostchtchie** in *chapter 6* is an example of a frost giant whose devotion to the demon lord has brought great and terrible rewards. (**Kostchtchie** is described in *Baldur's Gate: Descent into Avernus*.)

***Yeenoghu.*** Gnolls, ghouls, and some hill giants share two strange commonalities: insatiable hunger and a tendency to serve the demon lord Yeenoghu. Sometimes a hill giant who delights in senseless slaughter turns to the Beast of Butchery for help in achieving more senseless slaughter. Occasionally, an indiscriminately hungry hill giant consumes some item of unspeakable corruption and takes on a fiendish nature, falling under Yeenoghu's sway. In either case, the result is a horrible monster with a gullet akin to the bottomless Abyss itself (see the **maw of Yeenoghu** in *chapter 6*).

#### Elemental Evil

![King Snurre's hall houses a temple where drow priests lead rites to the Elder Elemental Eye](img/book/BGG/033-02-005.elemental-evil.webp)

Another popular avenue for giants who turn from the gods of the Ordning derives from giants' close ties to the Elemental Planes. The nameless horror called the Elder Elemental Eye perverts natural elements, limiting them to their most destructive aspects in a way that appeals to giants who are disposed toward evil. More than most members of individual Elemental Evil cults, giants see the big picture of the four cults working toward the common goal of elemental cataclysm. Some giants even worship the Elder Elemental Eye directly rather than serving one of the subordinate cults.

As described earlier in this chapter (see "*Rejecting the Ordning*"), membership in the cults of Elemental Evil replaces the ordning with a different hierarchy—one in which giants gravitate toward the top. Giants who worship Elemental Evil alongside smaller peoples offer welcome physical (and sometimes magical) power to these cults, making them an even more significant force in the world. Intelligent and charismatic giants might enter positions of leadership in an elemental cult, while less cunning giants might become lieutenants or personal bodyguards of cult leaders.

Examples of giants serving each of the Elemental Evil cults appear in *chapter 6*.

***Cult of Evil Earth.*** Giants who devote themselves to Ogrémoch and his earth cult—mostly hill and stone giants—seek the power to destroy the works of civilization with landslides, sinkholes, or mighty earthquakes. They believe the earth thirsts for the blood of those who don't give it proper veneration.

***Cult of Evil Water.*** Giant cultists of Olhydra are mostly frost giants who see ice and cold as ultimate expressions of water's destructive power. They believe the seas and deep waters are eager to reclaim the water trapped in the bodies of living creatures and feel duty-bound to return others to the primal waters by drowning them, shedding their blood, or freezing them in ice.

***Cult of Evil Fire.*** Fire giants who join Imix's cult yearn to burn away the impurities of the world in volcanic eruptions and uncontrolled fires, creating a wasteland of ash ruled by fiery Imix alone. They believe the world and all its peoples are wicked and degenerate and seek to purify the world by reducing it to smoking cinders.

***Cult of Evil Air.*** Giants who follow Yan-C-Bin and his air cult, mostly cloud and a few storm giants, worship the devastating power of wind and storms. They aren't generally interested in destruction for its own sake, but they delight in the power to punish those who have wronged them and to express personal freedom through mayhem.

***Other Evils.*** Some giants devote themselves to other powerful primordial creatures of the Elemental Planes, such as Maegera the Inferno, Mual-Tar the Thunder Serpent, and Draunn the Stonemaw. In practice, cults devoted to these primordials have similar aims and methods to cults of Elemental Evil.

#### Other Gods and Cults

Like other peoples, giants may choose to give their service and devotion to many different gods, not just the children of Annam or particular cults. On some worlds, the gods of the Ordning are unknown (perhaps forgotten) or known by different names. There, giants might have their own gods or worship the same gods other peoples do.

Giants might also turn from their traditional gods to serve devils, **krakens**, Great Old Ones, archfey, or other powerful ancient beings. *Chapter 6* includes examples of several such giants: the **fire hellion**, the **storm herald**, and the **fomorian warlock of the dark**.

### Gods and Adventures

The two tables in this section—the *Annam's Children Adventures table* and the *Interloper Gods Adventures table*—offer adventure hooks that involve the gods worshiped by giants.

*Many of my adventures in Diancastra's company revolved around combating the influence of these interloper gods among the giants. From the maddening corruption of Elemental Evil to the utter degradation of demon cults, I've seen the corrosive effect of these groups not just on individual giants, but on whole societies.*— Bigby*It's hard to express just how deeply most giants loathe and distrust those who turn to the service of interloper gods. It's not about religion; it's a betrayal of family.*— Diancastra

*It should not surprise me that the corruption of the Temple of Elemental Evil has spread far beyond my world of Greyhawk and infected even giants. It certainly does sadden me, though.*— Bigby
## Social Structures

Though giants are not numerous on most worlds (at least compared to various Humanoid peoples), they are generally social creatures who prefer to live with others of their own kind. They also keep appropriately sized animals as pets and beasts of burden, and they often share their living space with smaller people.

As you create an encounter, adventure, or campaign involving giants, you can use these models to help you decide how many giants are present in an area and what other creatures might live alongside them. You can use the various tables in "*Giantkind Encounters*" (in *chapter 3*) to flesh out the details of encounters with these giants.

>Giant Children
>
>Generally, it's a good idea to avoid situations where you treat a giant child as a monster. While even giant toddlers can be dangerous, they're no match for adventurers who can handle giant parents. Young giants are no more inherently evil than any other free-willed creature, so fighting and killing them can raise abundant moral questions for good-aligned characters. At minimum, make sure all your players are comfortable with that kind of quandary before presenting it in your game.
>
>If you need a stat block for a giant who is less than full grown, use the following guidelines (inspired by the examples presented in the *Storm King's Thunder* adventure).
>
>For a **giant child**, use the **commoner** stat block. Change the creature type to Giant, increase the Strength to 14 (+2), and choose Giant as the child's one language. The child attacks at +4 and deals 4 (1d4 + 2) bludgeoning damage with a club (which might be a toy or anything else the child picks up to use as a weapon).
>
>For a giant teenager, use the **ogre** stat block. Increase the Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores to 10 or match the parents' scores, whichever is lower. (This increases the teenager's passive Perception score to 10 as well.) Remove darkvision (unless the teenager is a stone giant) and adjust the teenager's weapons and armor as you see fit.
>
>For a young adult giant, use the stat block of a giant lower in the ordning. For example, *Storm King's Thunder* includes **young cloud giants** that use the **hill giant** stat block with several adjustments. You can craft the stat block as you see fit to match the challenge rating you're aiming for.
>
>For a giant child of any age, you can further modify one of these stat blocks by adding the parents' damage immunities and resistances (if any) and any inherent traits.
>

### Recluse

Though most giants are social creatures, some live alone by choice or circumstance. They establish lairs in remote places, or they tend ancient ruins or enclaves that were more recently abandoned. Some wander the world, hoping to learn as much of its ways as they can; others are hermits who seek spiritual enlightenment in solitude. Some reclusive giants enjoy their solitude, while others are desperately lonely or eager to find a settlement where they can live among their own kind.

The Recluses table offers adventure hooks you can use to launch an adventure with a reclusive giant.

##### Recluses

|  2  | A new settlement in a remote region seeks to hire adventurers to get rid of a giant lairing nearby. The giant just wants to be left alone and is tired of having to move every few decades as other creatures crowd too close to the giant's dwelling.                                                                                          |

|  4  | A wandering giant comes to a city looking for people who are knowledgeable about the world and might possess maps of remote regions. City authorities point the giant to the adventurers.                                                                                                                                                       |
|  5  | An approaching giant alarms the people of a small town, who ask the adventurers to protect them. But the peaceful giant is just searching for a new community of giants to join after fleeing a community ravaged by internal conflict. The giant agrees to leave the town in peace if the adventurers will help find a new home for the giant. |

### Exile

When giants are separated from or shunned by their own kind, they often end up living as exiles among other peoples. Giants who are very low in the ordning might leave their own kind to lord over lesser creatures. Giants who turn to the worship of interloper gods and are cast out of giants' society might live among other worshipers of the same gods. Occasionally, giants take up residence in bustling cities full of Humanoid peoples where they might attract attention but not necessarily open hostility.

Giants who live among smaller folk tend to gravitate to positions of importance. They might take on the role of crime lords or business owners. They often surround themselves with luxury as if they were aristocrats among their smaller neighbors. They sometimes take on the role of patrons for artists or adventurers, or take it upon themselves to teach smaller folk. The Exiles table offers ideas for adventures featuring exiled giants in a variety of such roles.

*Many giants who wander the world in solitude offer prayers and homage to me, and I keep an eye on them as best I can. We are not that different.*— Diancastra

### Band

![A small band of hill giants hunts across a ruin-studded landscape](img/book/BGG/034-02-006.hill-giant-hunters.webp)

The giants most commonly encountered in the world are bands of two to four who are united by a common purpose. These are often warriors engaged in raiding, hunting, or a mission on behalf of the leader of their home community. Sometimes these bands are religious in nature—a small community dedicated to the service of a god (whether a member of the Ordning or an interloper god) and pursuing that god's interests in the world. A band could also be a group of young giants who want to experience the world before they get tied down with the responsibilities of adult life. A giant band might be accompanied by pets or by other creatures that share the giants' purpose or do the giants' bidding.

The Bands table offers hooks you can use to build an adventure around a band of giants.

##### Bands

|:---:|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|  1  | A band of giants is spotted near a town, and the adventurers are asked to dissuade the giants from coming any closer.                                      |
|  2  | A raiding band of giants draws disaffected citizens of the region to join its ranks. The region's desperate despot hires adventurers to fight the giants.  |
|  3  | A giant-led cult devoted to a demon lord or Elemental Evil wreaks destruction across the countryside.                                                      |
|  4  | A band of nature-revering giants seeks adventurers' help dealing with a corruption spreading through the local flora and turning animals into Aberrations. |
|  5  | A band of hunting giants has driven its prey—enormous beasts—into pastureland. The local farmers seek help.                                                |
|  6  | Devout giants live a monastic life at a sacred site with vast magical power—power the adventurers require to deal with a cosmic threat.                    |

*From the perspective of smaller people, a roving giant band bent on mayhem or plunder is often the most common experience of giants. Even a small band can be extremely dangerous to a farming village or small town.*— Bigby
### Family

Most giants live in family groups, typically four to six adult giants from multiple generations and one or two younger giants. The work of hunting, gathering, or cultivating food, as well as other household tasks, is divided among family members according to their abilities. These groups often include at least one member with exceptional abilities, such as the magic-wielding giants found in *chapter 6*. Giant families almost always include companion animals as described in the *Monster Manual* and shown on the tables in "*Giantkind Encounters*" in *chapter 3*.

The Families table provides adventure hooks involving a family group of giants and its associated creatures.

##### Families
|  d6 | Adventure Hook                                                                                                                                                                      |
|:---:|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|  1  | After a family of giants plunders a farming village of grain and livestock, adventurers are asked to track the raiders to their lair and prevent any further raids.                 |
|  2  | After a devastating storm, a lost giant child wanders into a settlement, looking for help getting home.                                                                             |
|  3  | A giant begs adventurers for help after a family member becomes possessed by a murderous ghost.                                                                                     |
|  4  | Lost or stranded in the wilderness, the adventurers stumble upon a giant family's home.                                                                                             |
|  5  | Adventurers follow or track a fugitive to a giant family's home, where the villain hides from both the giants and the characters.                                                   |
|  6  | Characters seeking a mighty magical artifact learn it was lost during a battle against giants, and magical divination reveals it's now an heirloom treasured by a family of giants. |

### Steading

Giants live in larger groups when circumstances allow it. Such circumstances might include an abundant food supply, a charismatic or powerful leader who can unite multiple families, or a dangerous environment where the giants benefit from greater numbers. In these situations, two or three family groups might dwell together in some kind of stronghold, often accompanied by companion animals and Humanoid allies.

The total population of a steading typically includes eight to twelve adult giants, including a leader, and three to five younger giants. Sometimes a few ettins or ogres and as many as two dozen Humanoids might live alongside the giants. Animal companions, elementals, and even a dragon might also dwell in a giant steading.

Any of the locations described in *chapter 4* might serve as a giant steading, and you can use the tables in *chapter 3* to help you populate the site. The Steadings table suggests adventure hooks you might use to bring characters to such a place.

##### Steadings
|  d6 | Adventure Hook                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
|:---:|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|  1  | A young giant looks for adventurers' help turning the rest of the steading, including the young giant's family, away from the worship of a demon lord.                                                          |
|  2  | The only possible source to learn about an ancient evil threatening the world is a steading of giants who preserved a detailed history of the evil's previous appearance thousands of years ago.                |
|  3  | Giants raided a village and took several prisoners to their steading, and adventurers must free them.                                                                                                           |
|  4  | An evil conqueror tries to recruit giants from a steading, which would be disastrous for the peaceful peoples standing against the conqueror. Adventurers are asked to make sure no alliance is made.           |
|  5  | A dozen people arrive in a small town after escaping from captivity in a giant steading. Their fierce habits disrupt the peace in the town while they look for heroes who can help free the remaining captives. |
|  6  | A metallic dragon asks adventurers to help reclaim the dragon's lair, which has been occupied by giants.                                                                                                        |

*In my experience, nearly every steading or larger settlement of giants has a leader who imagines their tiny cluster of giants is an echo of a glorious fallen empire. Even the giants struggle to imagine the grandeur of what they once had and have now lost.*— Diancastra
### Settlement

Larger settlements of giants are rare. Where they do exist, they are typically clusters of family groups and steadings in close proximity, united under the leadership of an exceptional ruler. A mountain might have several steadings and households at various points along its slopes, for example. Or a vast Underdark chasm might have many caves in its walls, each of which holds a giant steading linked to the others by a tangled network of bridges.

Steadings that make up a larger settlement are often arranged geographically according to the ordning ranking of the giants who live there. A giant sovereign's steading might be at the peak of a mountain or in the depths of a chasm. High-status giants populate nearby steadings, while the lowest-ranking giants inhabit those farthest away.

A larger settlement includes many Humanoid inhabitants, as well as companion animals and other creatures of the Giant type, such as ettins, ogres, or cyclopes. Often these are divided among the component steadings, but sometimes they live in a different part of the settlement—on the lower slopes of a mountain, for example.

The Settlements table offers adventure hooks that might bring adventurers to one of these places.

|  2  | Adventurers are sent on a diplomatic mission to a giant sovereign to ask permission to open new mines in the giants' territory.                                                                                       |
|  3  | Adventurers need to infiltrate a giants' settlement to discover who is leading its ruler on the path to war.                                                                                                          |
|  4  | The death of a giant monarch is an opportunity for adventurers to help a giant who has a peaceable attitude toward smaller folk to claim the throne.                                                                  |
|  5  | Characters investigating a magical catastrophe discover that it engulfed a giants' settlement, and the giants need help dealing with its effects.                                                                     |
|  6  | Adventurers are asked to deliver a ransom to a giants' settlement to secure the freedom of a very important captive, but the giants decide the adventurers would be even more valuable captives!                      |

## Organizations

Many giants are oriented to small family groups or particular interests of their kind. However, some organizations unite giants across the divides of the ordning and of devotion to particular deities or powers in pursuit of a common purpose. This section presents examples of such organizations whose interests extend across small regions, whole worlds, or multiple worlds.

### Hidden Rune

![Giants of the Hidden Rune explore a ruin with help from smaller assistants](img/book/BGG/035-02-007.giants-exploration.webp)

To the giants of the Hidden Rune, the children of Annam are in a temporary state of decline, a pause between two great moments in their history. The mission of this scholarly order is to collect the accumulated learning of the past and preserve it so a future giant civilization can build upon it.

Giants of the Hidden Rune are active across many worlds of the Material Plane. On worlds that had giant empires in the ancient past (such as Ostoria in the Forgotten Realms and the giant empire of Xen'drik in Eberron), members of the Hidden Rune venture into the ruins of these lost civilizations to collect any writings, technology, and artifacts they find. On worlds with no historical record of such past glories, members of the organization nevertheless search for any remnants of an empire that might have been forgotten. If traveling giants from other worlds discover a rare world where giants' civilization is flourishing, they strive to document every aspect of that civilization.

A key assumption underpinning their work is that these ancient giant empires sprang from a common source—perhaps Annam and his sons, or a single civilization that colonized other worlds. By gathering as much information as possible about the ancient empires, the scholars hope to piece together a picture of the proto-empire behind them all.

The Hidden Rune maintains a vast archive in a secret location on the Elemental Plane of Earth. Miners work constantly to excavate new halls to store the troves of knowledge gathered by the order's agents across the Material Plane. Scholars pore over each new item in the collection, assessing its place not only in the history of the world it came from but also in the overall history of giants.

Unlike various religious groups among giants, such as the destructive priests of Surtur and the hopeful followers of Iallanis, the giants of the Hidden Rune do not believe they have any active role to play in building the future of giantkind. They are concerned only with preserving the past so that giants of the future—however that grand future might come into being—can access the riches of this knowledge.

#### Hidden Rune Adventures

The Hidden Rune Adventures table suggests ways characters on any world might encounter agents of this order.

|  2  | After adventurers discover an artifact made by ancient giants, an agent of the Hidden Rune approaches them and demands the item for the order's archive.                                               |
|  3  | A collector hires adventurers to retrieve stolen items, but the thief has already sold the items to a giant. The chase could lead all the way to the Elemental Plane of Earth.                         |
|  4  | An agent of the Hidden Rune is unable to open the sealed entrance to an ancient ruin. The giant lures adventurers there, hoping they'll figure it out.                                                 |
|  5  | A comet appears in the sky, last seen when giants ruled the world. Adventurers discover there is information about the comet in the Hidden Rune's archive, if the giants can be persuaded to share it. |
|  6  | An agent of the Hidden Rune steals an important artifact and flees to another world, but the adventurers have a chance to follow.                                                                      |

*There's a myth behind the name of the Hidden Rune. According to this story, Annam gave the great giant empires of the past access to a rune of such enormous power that it guaranteed their dominance over the world. But when the empires fell, one of the giant gods (Diancastra, in some versions of the myth!) took the rune and hid it. The giants of the Hidden Rune hope to find it and use its power to restore their ancient might.*— Bigby*If these stories are true, I'd be the last to tell you!*— Diancastra
### Stewards of the Eternal Throne

Myths and histories include many explanations for the decline of giants' ancient empires and Annam's abandonment of his descendants. The Stewards of the Eternal Throne posit the ancient giants failed in their responsibility to care for the lesser peoples of the worlds. Instead of tending the worlds Annam made and guiding their inhabitants toward greater wisdom and prosperity, the giants tried to rule the worlds, exploit their resources, and subjugate their peoples. For this sin, the stewards believe Annam cast down the giants' empires and turned his back on his children. Only by undoing that folly can giants return to their intended place in Annam's creation and regain his favor.

The Stewards of the Eternal Throne are organized as a knightly order with many chapters. Each chapter encompasses all the stewards who live across a wide geographical region, perhaps a continent or an entire world of the Material Plane, and is led by a chief steward. Each chapter is independent from all others, and the chief stewards of different chapters rarely meet and coordinate their efforts, except in cases where evils arise that threaten an entire world or multiple worlds.

Members of the Stewards of the Eternal Throne swear an oath of service to the order's mission. The specifics of the oath vary from chapter to chapter, but the fundamental tenets are the same in every chapter:

- **Stewardship.** We are custodians of the worlds, not rulers, and we work to preserve what has been entrusted to our care.
- **Protection.** Smaller and weaker peoples deserve our protection, not subjugation. We are strong and shelter the smaller folk behind our strength.
- **Education.** Though we have forgotten much of the wisdom of our ancestors, we strive to ensure all peoples can pursue wisdom, learning, and enlightenment.
- **Peace.** We foster peace among all peoples. All who desire to live peaceably together are welcome among us.

Knights of the Stewards of the Eternal Throne are mostly giants (predominantly cloud and storm giants), but some orders have been known to accept goliaths, firbolgs, and members of other peoples into their ranks. (Goliaths and firbolgs appear as character races in *Mordenkainen Presents: Monsters of the Multiverse*, and examples of these peoples appear in *chapter 6* of this book.)

The principle of peace leads the knights to cooperate with other peoples, especially with beings they regard as near equals in age and importance, including dwarves, elves, and dragons. If a fundamental sin of the ancient giants was warring with these folk in the early years of the world, then cooperation with them is essential to undoing that sin and charting a new course for giantkind and other peoples. As part of this commitment, the stewards honor not just the gods of the giants, but also the gods revered by these other folk.

Each chapter of the Stewards of the Eternal Throne has a stronghold that is intended as a living embodiment of its central principles. These strongholds are mighty fortresses meant to withstand whatever evils might besiege them. They are bastions of peace and equality where diverse peoples can live together under the leadership, protection, and tutelage of giants—as Annam intended.

### Worldroot Circle

A saga chanted among the giants of the Worldroot Circle describes a great tree that grew on the First World at the dawn of time. Planted and tended by the god Corellon, this tree was a seedling of the mighty Yggdrasil, the World Tree that connects all the Outer Planes. When the First World was destroyed, seeds from this great tree scattered into the void of the Material Plane. Myths say Annam nurtured each of these seeds until they sprouted and formed worlds of their own—all the myriad worlds that now constitute the Material Plane.

Giants of the Worldroot Circle tell this story as a way to remember their purpose. They imagine themselves to be Annam's gardeners, tasked with tending the roots of all the worlds he made. On some worlds, they literally tend a great world tree they believe to be a seedling of the tree on the First World. On other worlds, they believe some other geographical feature is the "root of the world," such as a towering mountain or mesa, a yawning cavern deep under the mountains, or a meteorite in an enormous crater. Whatever forms these roots take, the giants believe they are nexus points linking the worlds to each other and to the Outer Planes.

When giants of the Worldroot Circle gather at the roots of their worlds, they perform rites meant to preserve the roots, nurture the health of the world, and enable a mystical communion among members of the order—both the ones present and those on other worlds. Much like Humanoid druids, these giants strive to maintain the forces of nature in their delicate balance and oppose any forces—even the forces of gods such as Surtur and Thrym—that threaten to elevate one element over the others or to distort the elements beyond their natural proportions.

#### Worldroot Circle Adventures

Though the giants of the Worldroot Circle tend to live in remote wildernesses, they protect their worlds and are often concerned with global or even planar threats. They fiercely oppose the cults of Elemental Evil and remain constantly vigilant against unnatural corruption, including Undead and Aberrations. They guard against forces that threaten to undo the work of creation or corrupt the roots of the worlds, including destructive demons. The Worldroot Circle Adventures table provides examples of how these druidic giants might become involved in adventures in your campaign.

# Chapter 3: Giant Adventures

*Diancastra's divine nature was not revealed to me until our second meeting, when she helped me put an end to a cult dedicated to Elemental Evil and its leader, a truly vicious cloud giant. I think she appreciated what our fists together could do!*— BigbyThis chapter, intended for the Dungeon Master, is full of tables and inspiration you can use to build encounters, adventures, and entire worlds and campaigns that give giants a properly giant-sized role. The chapter has three parts:

"*Encounters*" provides tools to help you build encounters involving giants and the creatures that frequently accompany them. You can use the tables in this section to populate the giant-themed locations in *chapter 4* or any other encounter.

"*Adventures*" includes adventure hooks and other tools you can use to craft an adventure involving giants and their worlds.

"*Campaigns*" helps you establish the role of giants in your game world and place these mighty peoples—past or present—in the forefront of your campaign.

![](img/book/BGG/037-03-001.bigby-smash.webp)

## Encounters

Giants are social creatures, often living together in families or bands, or accompanied by smaller followers. Even when they live in isolation, they often keep pets or servants. While an encounter might consist of a single giant, more typical encounters include a mix of one or more giants with other creatures.

This section is loaded with inspiration to help you create such encounters, whether you're planning a single encounter or populating a giant-filled enclave. The tables are broken into two categories: "*Giantkind Encounters*" and "*Connected Creatures*." The first includes tables for each of the six main families of giants, plus death giants and fomorians. The second covers a variety of other creatures often found alongside giants, including other creatures of the Giant type.

### Using the Tables

When a creature's name appears in **bold** type, that's a visual cue pointing you to its stat block. Creatures marked with an asterisk (*) appear in this book. Those marked with a dagger (†) appear in *Mordenkainen Presents: Monsters of the Multiverse*. (Where those monsters appear, a note to the table tells you what to do if you don't have that book.) All other creatures are described in the *Monster Manual*. If a Humanoid creature's kind is not specified, it can be any kind of Humanoid you choose.

Giants are dangerous foes. The encounter tables in this section are most suitable for use with characters in the third tier of play (levels 11–16). If you're creating giant-themed encounters for lower-level characters, you might use more dangerous creatures in the background to establish the setting of the adventure, or use them in a nonhostile capacity. For example, if you're creating encounters for a 6th-level party, a fight against two storm giants would make for a dreadfully one-sided battle. Instead, the characters could witness the giants in an altercation from a distance, foreshadowing a conflict that will threaten all the smaller folk in the region. Or you could decide the giants are indifferent or friendly toward the characters, leading to a dramatic interaction that might offer hooks to adventures more appropriate to your party's level. See the "Giants and Tiers of Play" sidebar for more advice.

>Giants and Tiers of Play
>
>The giants of the ordning are appropriate threats for characters who have significant experience. When you plan giant encounters, pay attention to how much damage the giants can deal in a single attack. Many giants can kill lower-level characters with a single hit.
>
>Use the guidelines in the *Dungeon Master's Guide* or *Xanathar's Guide to Everything* to build appropriately challenging encounters for your party. The guidelines here can help you plan adventures featuring giants for each tier of play:
>
>- **First Tier (Levels 1–4).** **Ogres** are the most suitable Giant opponents for characters in the first tier of play, and characters at level 4 might face a single **hill giant**. A lone hill giant can feel confident bullying (or eating) the inhabitants of a village, but more powerful giants (and larger groups) set their sights higher.
>- **Second Tier (Levels 5–10).** A single **stone**, **frost**, **fire**, or **cloud giant** is an appropriate challenge for characters in this tier. Near the top of this tier, characters might challenge two **hill giants** or possibly a **storm giant**. The intrusion of these giants into settled lands is a threat that a whole kingdom or region notices.
>- **Third Tier (Levels 11–16).** Three to five **hill giants** are an appropriate challenge for characters at this level, as are two to three **stone** or **frost giants**, two **fire** or **cloud giants**, or a single **storm giant**. Large groups of giants, when they are organized toward a single purpose, can determine the fate of nations.
>- **Fourth Tier (Levels 17–20).** Mighty characters in the fourth tier can challenge as many as eight **hill giants**, four to five **stone** or **frost giants**, three to five **fire** or **cloud giants**, or two to three **storm giants**. When giants in significant numbers work toward a common cause, they can alter the nature of worlds.

#### Encounter Context

Each table entry presents a short description of the creatures in an encounter and what they're doing. Use these ideas as inspiration to fit the encounter into the location you're populating. If that context doesn't make sense for the situation you're building, consider using the context to inspire the creature's general motivation. For example, if you roll a 12 on the *Cloud Giant Encounters table*, it might not make sense for a cloud giant to be searching for the *Misty Vale* (an enclave described in *chapter 4*) in that particular location. You might decide there is a clue to the vale's location in this place, or you can simply treat the giant's search for the Misty Vale as an overarching goal, regardless of what the giant is doing when the encounter occurs. That choice can influence how you roleplay the giant if the characters engage in conversation.

#### Initial Attitude

Each creature on these tables includes a suggested attitude roll in parentheses after its name. To randomly determine the initial attitude of creatures in an encounter, roll the dice specified in the parentheses, then refer to the appropriate line of the Initial Attitudes table.

##### Initial Attitudes
| Attitude Roll Total | Initial Attitude |
|---------------------|------------------|
| 4 or lower          | Hostile          |
| 5–8                 | Indifferent      |
| 9 or higher         | Friendly         |

If an attitude doesn't fit what the creature is doing, you can either ignore the attitude or shape the encounter to match it. For example, if you roll an indifferent or friendly attitude for a creature that is hunting prey, you might decide the hunter simply doesn't find the characters to be a tasty treat. If the creature is sapient, it could ask the characters if they've seen which way its quarry has gone.

### Giantkind Encounters

This section includes encounter tables themed around each of the six kinds of giants in the *Monster Manual*, plus *death giants* (found in *chapter 6*) and *fomorians*. Each table includes giants as well as creatures that might be found in or around the homes of giants, including those commonly associated with giants as pets (such as **spotted lions** for **cloud giants** and **dire wolves** for **hill giants**).

>Pick a Giant, Any Giant
>
>If you'd like to randomly determine the kind of giants that are dominant in a location, roll on the Giantkind Encounters table. You could also roll twice and use the resulting two tables to create either a cooperative or rival relationship between the indicated giants.

#### Cloud Giant Encounters

Cloud giants and related creatures thrive where there is fantastic wealth to be earned, plundered, or swindled; where there are secrets to be uncovered; and where diplomacy or guile can carry the day.

The Death Giant Encounters table is appropriate for places steeped in gloom, whether within the Shadowfell or touched by that plane's sorrowful influence. The creatures on this table might populate places where giants fell into despair, sites where giants delved too deeply into necromantic magic, or areas where the Negative Plane's life-consuming influence seeps into the world.

#### Fomorian Encounters

The Fomorian Encounters table presents encounters that can occur in underground regions or at surface locations suffering an invasion from the depths. These encounters also fit well for places warped by the strange corruption of the Far Realm. Using these encounters to supplement another table can hint at deeper threats that are just beginning to burst through the fabric of the multiverse.

The Hill Giant Encounters table presents hill giants alongside other creatures driven by hunger. These encounters are good for straightforward adventures that don't focus on twists and guile. These creatures simply seek to indulge their endless hunger.

#### Stone Giant Encounters

The Stone Giant Encounters table presents stone giants and creatures that might appear in areas they inhabit, either by choice or because of geography. Sapient creatures might be drawn to stone giant artwork and stone shaping, or they might be caught in the giants' passion for seeking truth and insight from their dreams.

These creatures can appear on the surface rather than in typical stone giant tunnels. Perhaps they're following the giants on a quest to the "dream world" that is the surface, or maybe they're trading and conferring with such giants when they emerge.

#### Storm Giant Encounters

The Storm Giant Encounters table includes storm giants as well as creatures that relate to or resonate with storm giant themes. Storm giants usually remain solitary, but they can get tangled in events that relate to prophecies and omens. These encounters might happen anywhere, at any time, and can be a sign on their own of momentous events to come.

### Connected Creatures

The encounter tables in this section include a variety of monsters grouped according to themes that might flavor a giant enclave or encounter. Combined with the encounters from the "*Giantkind Encounters*" section, you can create a series of events with a distinctive flavor.

#### Dinosaur World Encounters

Use the Dinosaur World Encounters table to populate "lost worlds" sequestered from the Material Plane during a long-forgotten era when dinosaurs ruled the world (with or without the presence of giants), or bustling settlements where giants use domesticated dinosaurs as companions and beasts of burden—perhaps using deinonychus as hunting hounds or herding triceratops like cattle.

Domesticated dinosaurs might have a variety of trappings—markings, brands, harnesses, collars, or saddles—that reflect the culture and nature of the giants who care for them. Hill giants might use crude twisted rope or rough leather cords, while storm giants could use bridles of spun copper that spark when touched or masterfully woven seaweed saddles.

#### Elemental Encounters

Use the four Elemental Encounters tables to populate areas suffused with the elemental and magical nature of giants or places where the Elemental Planes break into the Material Plane. The creatures on these tables might be connected to the cults of Elemental Evil (described in *chapter 2*). Magical conduits might draw creatures from the Elemental Planes and disgorge them within powerful storms, deep chasms, tumultuous wildfires, or ocean maelstroms. Elemental forces might also come to the world to oppose their elemental rivals from opposite planes: air versus earth or fire versus water.

The elemental forces of air are most commonly connected with **cloud** and **storm giants**. Those of earth are typically associated with **hill** and **stone giants**. Elemental fire is closely tied to **fire giants**, and elemental water is typically connected to **cloud** and **frost giants**.

The Elemental Water Encounters table can be useful in any aquatic environment, not just one where the Plane of Water extends its reach. An ancient giant enclave sunken in some great catastrophe or a storm giant retreat beneath the sea is an appropriate locale for these encounters.

#### Fiendish Incursion Encounters

Use the Fiendish Incursion Encounters table for situations where giants have turned from the gods of the Ordning to serve fiends (as described in *chapter 2*), where the ancient magic of long-fallen realms of giants opened portals to the Lower Planes (either intentionally or by accident), where magic runes have gone horribly awry and unleashed fiendish corruption into the world, or where fiends seek powerful allies to aid their schemes among mortals.

*Listen. I have glimpsed the pages of Iggwilv's Demonomicon. I've felt the soul-chilling touch of an incubus. I've even ventured to more than one of the Lower Planes. Somehow none of these things compares to the sheer horror of a giant transformed into something much, much worse by the corruption of a demon lord.*— Bigby<table class="rd__b-special rd__b-data  rd__b-data--stats">

#### Giant Construct Encounters

Use the Giant Construct Encounters table to populate ancient giants' ruins that have been sealed from the outside world for millennia or hostile environments without breathable air. The creatures in these encounters might also act as servitors to magically powerful giants or serve as a reminder of the forgotten magic of ancient giants.

You can alter the appearance of any Construct on this table to reflect the nature of its creators. An iron golem built by fire giants might spew embers and sooty smoke between its iron plates, while one built by cloud giants might leak wisps of mist and raindrops. Any of these Constructs might have Giant runes engraved somewhere on them as part of the magic that animates them. You can alter any Construct's size without changing any of the creature's other statistics.

The Giant Kin Encounters table presents a range of creatures of the Giant type that are not encompassed by the ordning, along with related creatures that might be pursuing their own schemes or working as part of a giant's machinations. These giant kin might be drawn to runes and sites of giant power, even long after the creators of those sites are gone.

#### Giant Necropolis Encounters

Use the Giant Necropolis Encounters table to populate places where giants once thrived that have been destroyed, fallen into decline, or succumbed to necromantic magic. The meddling of death giants or the planar influence of the Shadowfell might cause a giant enclave to decay quickly into a necropolis where creatures such as the ones on this table flourish.

Even without a theme of undeath, you can use these encounters to add a flavor of despair or to suggest Undead giants are interested in a location for mysterious reasons.

#### Megafauna World Encounters

The Megafauna World Encounters table suggests encounters with gigantic animals that might appear in a "lost world" where long-forgotten versions of modern animals still thrive. It could also reflect a world where not only giants but everything—from domestic animals to plant life—is vastly oversized (see "*Into the Giant Realms*" in the "*Adventure Models*" section later in this chapter).

As with the dinosaurs on the *Dinosaur World Encounters table*, you can add a variety of trappings to the animals encountered here to reflect the nature of the giants who care for them.

## Adventures

Giants often appear in adventures that aren't about giants, serving as powerful enemies or allies to adventurers. This section offers inspiration if you want to make giants or the realms they inhabit a central element of an adventure. This section has two parts:

"*Adventure Models*" outlines five categories of adventures to help you think about the role you want giants to play.

"*Giant Patrons*" explores various roles a giant might adopt as a patron for an adventuring party and the missions the giant might assign.

### Adventure Models

Giants serve as adversaries in many D&D adventures, but that's not the only possible role for them in your game. This section outlines five broad categories of adventures, including suggested adventure hooks for each category.

#### Against the Giants

Three of D&D's earliest published adventures featured giants as the primary opponents: *Steading of the Hill Giant Chief*, *The Glacial Rift of the Frost Giant Jarl*, and *Hall of the Fire Giant King*. (They were originally published in 1978, compiled together as *Against the Giants* in 1981, and reprinted multiple times in the decades since, most recently in 2017's *Tales from the Yawning Portal*.) The premise of these adventures is simple: "giants have been raiding civilized lands," so adventurers are assembled "to punish the miscreant giants." The adventurers fight their way up the ordning until their final confrontation with the fire giant king—and the revelation that the giants are merely pawns in the schemes of some sinister drow.

An adventure focused on giants as adversaries could involve a sustained battle against giants of a single kind (as each of the individual adventures in *Against the Giants* did), or it could involve progression through groups of different kinds of giants (as *Against the Giants* pitted characters against hill, frost, and fire giants in sequence). Alternatively, an adventure could involve giants of different kinds working together, perhaps united as members of a religious order or some other kind of organization that crosses the divide of giant kinds (see "*Gods and Religion*" and "*Organizations*," both in *chapter 2*).

The Against the Giants table offers suggestions for adventure hooks you can use to build an adventure following this theme.

*On the world I call home, three linked mountain ranges—the Crystalmist Mountains, the Jotens, and the Hellfurnaces—are inhabited by fierce giants who launch all-too-frequent raids into the nearby lands of the Yeomanry, Sterich, and Geoff.*— Bigby

|:---:|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|  1  | Adventurers find a village completely deserted, with tracks leading to a hill giant steading. Can they rescue the surviving villagers and livestock before the **hill giants** eat them all?                                                              |
|  2  | A family of **stone giants** fell under the sway of Lolth and allied with Lolth-worshiping drow to raid the surface. Adventurers must break the alliance or eliminate the stone giants if necessary.                                                      |
|  3  | An especially harsh winter is accompanied by roving bands of **frost giants** and **winter wolves** preying on travelers.                                                                                                                                 |
|  4  | **Fire giants** send **hell hounds** into mine tunnels to chase the miners out, then send their own azer servants to plunder the mineral-rich mines. The miners seek help to reclaim their mines.                                                         |
|  5  | A clever **cloud giant** plays several other powerful creatures against each other and against nearby Humanoids. Eliminating the giant will return the volatile situation to an uneasy status quo.                                                        |
|  6  | A **frost giant** leads a mixed band of weaker giants in a campaign of bloodlust to honor Thrym or a demon lord.                                                                                                                                          |
|  7  | After a villainous group slays a young **storm giant**, the giant's parent unleashes an undiscriminating campaign of vengeance against any "interfering little gnats" living nearby.                                                                      |
|  8  | As characters explore a steading belonging to one kind of giant (you can roll a d6 on this table to decide why the characters are there), they discover an honored guest of a more powerful giant kind who is coordinating the weaker giants' activities. |

#### Clash of Titans

Sometimes giants are background elements to an adventure that has more to do with the impact of the giants' actions on the world than it does with the giants themselves. These adventures might be disaster stories, where characters might help bystanders escape. The source of the disaster might be a conflict between two giants (or two groups of giants), a clash between a giant and another powerful monster (such as a dragon, a dinosaur, a **purple worm**, or the **tarrasque**), or the stirring of a truly colossal giant (such as the *scions of giants' gods* described in *chapter 6*). An adventure might also challenge characters to drive the giants (and other forces of destruction) away from settled lands.

The giant in a scenario like this need not be the villain. A **storm giant** wrestling a **kraken** to keep the creature from destroying a coastal city might still cause accidental devastation. A giant might look for heroes to take care of bystanders while the giant deals with (or holds back) the greater threat.

The Clash of Titans table provides a sampling of adventure hooks you can use to build an adventure along these lines.

|:---:|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|  1  | Frost giants besiege a fire giant settlement, disrupting travel and trade across the region. Injured frost giants shelter in nearby towns, demanding the people there serve them while they recover.                                      |
|  2  | A dragon and a giant, in the middle of a fierce battle, suddenly fall from the sky into a town square. Neither combatant is concerned about protecting the people around them.                                                            |
|  3  | Hired to guard a caravan heading to a remote mountain town, adventurers find the pass blocked with rockslides caused by stone giants at play.                                                                                             |
|  4  | A group of giants (perhaps members of the Stewards of the Eternal Throne, described in *chapter 2*) warns a city that the **tarrasque** is approaching and asks for heroes to evacuate the city while the giants hold the monster at bay. |
|  5  | A terrifying storm lashes a fishing village for days. After helping people get to safety, the adventurers investigate the storm, and they discover a storm giant locked in battle with a kraken nearby.                                   |
|  6  | After slumbering for centuries, a **scion of Grolantor** (described in *chapter 6)*, begins to stir. The residents of the farming village built on the sleeping giant's back seek help evacuating.                                        |

#### Delve into the Past

*The best reason for delving into the past is to discover a path to a better future.*— DiancastraIn the world of Eberron, the continent of Xen'drik is the ancestral home of giants and the location of their ancient empire. The continent is littered with the cyclopean ruins of this forgotten civilization, and now scholars and treasure hunters mount expeditions to plunder the ruins and unearth the secrets of the giants. On other worlds, the ruins of ancient giants' civilizations might not be as numerous or well known, but you can still build adventures that lead characters to explore the realms of past giants.

An expedition into giants' ruins might involve a confrontation with giants, or it might mean facing whatever monsters have taken up residence in the ruins in the centuries since the giants abandoned them. In Xen'drik, living giants still inhabit some of their ancient ruins, though they have fallen far from the height of their civilization. Ruins might be inhabited by the once-giant hulks or Undead giants that appear in *chapter 6*, by Constructs crafted by giants, or by any kind of creature that has taken shelter in the ruins—potentially including enormous creatures, such as dragons, that appreciate the roomy chambers crafted by ancient giants.

You can use the Delve into the Past table to inspire adventures leading characters into ancient giant ruins. You can also use the locations in *chapter 4* as destinations for these adventures; each of those locations includes its own suggested adventure hooks that you can use instead, or combine with the ones here, as inspiration strikes you.

|  5  | Adventurers tracking a monster discover its lair in an ancient giants' ruin. While they hunt the monster, they can also piece together the history of the place.                         |
|  6  | Characters exploring a strange ruin accidentally trigger magic that causes seven flying castles—including the one the characters are in—to rise into the sky from where they had fallen. |

#### Giant-Sized Schemes

Giants are mythical creatures, descended from a god and imbued with the raw energy of the Elemental Planes. But they're also people whose relationships, ambitions, emotions, and subterfuge are literally larger than life. The intrigue among storm giant King Hekaton's daughters in *Storm King's Thunder* is an example of how interpersonal dramas can shake the whole world when they play out on the stage of a giant's realm.

The Giant-Sized Schemes table offers suggestions, including several inspired by the plots of famous dramas.

##### Giant-Sized Schemes

|  1  | The ghost of a murdered giant monarch appears to the monarch's heirs and demands they claim vengeance. The heirs and the murderer end up in a wide-ranging conflict that threatens to devastate settlements near the giants' realm.              |
|  2  | Convinced she is the rightful ruler of another giant's domain, a giant launches an invasion, heedless of the inhabitants of the lands between the giants' realms.                                                                                |
|  3  | Believing his sovereign has violated the ordning by promoting an inferior giant instead of him, a scheming giant hires adventurers to undermine the sovereign's authority.                                                                       |

#### Into the Giant Realms

In Jonathan Swift's novel *Gulliver's Travels*, the protagonist is swept off course on a sea voyage and finds himself in the land of Brobdingnag, where everything is twelve times its usual size, from people to rats. In Jules Verne's *Journey to the Center of the Earth*, explorers discover a subterranean world where giant-sized people tend herds of mastodons and where reptiles from Earth's ancient past still roam the sea and sky. The English fairy tale of Jack climbing a beanstalk to a giant's cloud castle is a similar example of an adventurer passing into a world of giants. In Norse myth, giants inhabit the realm of Jotunheim, where brave gods and heroes occasionally venture on dangerous quests.

![Three brave urchins seem to have stepped through the wrong doorway in Waterdeep!](img/book/BGG/043-03-007.giants-and-urchins.webp)

An adventure inspired by these tales might see characters discovering a secret valley hidden in a remote mountain range where storm giants tend flocks of sheep the size of horses, delving deep into the Underdark where stone giants ride mammoths across vast subterranean plains, washing up on an uncharted island whose giant inhabitants hunt dinosaurs, or entering a demiplane where a portion of the ancient world of the giants is perfectly preserved. The characters might be lost travelers or bold explorers, or they might journey to these wondrous locations in search of some treasure or powerful magic used by the giants.

The Into the Giant Realms table offers more suggestions for how to bring characters to these realms.

|  1  | A fissure opens during an earthquake, and ordinary means can't determine its depth. Adventurers are asked to explore it and determine the source of the light that is barely visible far below. |
|  2  | Characters find a coded journal in a dragon's treasure hoard, indicating a path to a hidden paradise.                                                                                           |
|  3  | Adventurers find a giant-sized ring inscribed with the sigil sequence for a teleportation circle.                                                                                               |
|  4  | An enormous stone archway is carved with symbols that, when touched in the correct sequence, activate a portal.                                                                                 |
|  5  | A strange map shows a road where no road exists. During solstices, the road appears and stretches in an impossible direction to a mysterious destination.                                       |
|  6  | Characters acquire a broken piece of an artifact that magically guides them to the location of another piece, which is in a realm of giants.                                                    |

***Giants of Surtland.*** Surtland is an example of a realm of giants inspired by Norse myth. This realm is one of ten worlds that make up the Magic: The Gathering setting of Kaldheim, all moving among the branches of a vast World Tree. Wintry Surtland is a realm of constant turmoil. Volcanoes burst through snow and ice to form new mountains as the bitter cold freezes steaming geysers into sprays of ice shards. Earthquakes and volcanic eruptions reshape the landscape almost daily. Avalanches of snow and broken rock tumble down mountainsides and change the course of half-frozen rivers.

The frost and fire giants of Surtland are locked in constant conflict. The frost giants prefer to be left alone, but they also claim the best, safest territories in the realm, building gleaming ice palaces on high mountain peaks and glacier fields. In addition, they hoard treasures and arcane secrets for themselves. The fire giants build shelters in the lowlands, where lava fissures carve paths through wide fields of snow, and the fire giants gather in bands to attack the frost giants.

At times, the worlds of Kaldheim overlap as they move around the World Tree. Such an overlap—called a Doomskar—is an explosive event marked by world-altering earthquakes and geological destabilization. You can use the idea of a Doomskar to bring Surtland (or a realm like it) into contact and conflict with your campaign world. During the Doomskar, characters can venture into Surtland, but giants can also raid into the other world.

### Giant Patrons

Many of the adventure hooks throughout this book involve giants asking characters for help or hiring them to carry out a task. This section outlines long-term patron roles giants might fill.

If you want to use a giant as a patron for a group of adventurers, you can use the perks, contacts, and roles described in the "*Group Patrons*" chapter of *Tasha's Cauldron of Everything* alongside the adventure hooks and other information included here. Each of the roles described here corresponds (at least loosely) to a patron type described in that book, as shown on the Giant Patrons table.

##### Giant Patrons
|  Giant Role |  Group Patron Type |
|:-----------:|:------------------:|
|    *Boss*   | Criminal Syndicate |
| *Financier* |     Aristocrat     |
|    *Seer*   |    Ancient Being   |
| *Sovereign* |      Sovereign     |
|   *Tutor*   |       Academy      |
| *Warleader* |   Military Force   |

#### Boss

A giant boss wields size and strength as tools to extract wealth and power from communities of smaller folk. The boss might threaten to harm adventurers or those they care about if they refuse to do the giant's bidding. Or the boss might recruit adventurers to share in the profits of a morally and legally questionable enterprise.

The archetypal giant boss is a hill giant, perhaps cleverer than most, who enjoys demonstrating just how superior a giant's strength is compared to smaller creatures. Such a boss might run a protection racket, a group of highway robbers, or a kidnapping ring. A giant boss might even take to a life of piracy, following in the enormous footsteps of Huzza, a hill giant in the world of the Forgotten Realms.

The Boss Assignments table suggests the kinds of missions a giant boss might send adventurers on.

|  1  | Thieves stole the giant's most precious treasure and fled into the sewers, where the giant can't follow. Hunt the thieves and retrieve the treasure.       |
|  2  | A rival gang is encroaching on the giant's territory. Spy on these rivals, and identify the best place for the giant to strike to shut them down for good. |
|  3  | Somebody who works for the giant is stealing. Find out who it is, and make sure they never think about double-crossing the giant again.                    |
|  4  | The giant has a score to settle with a powerful foe (perhaps a dragon, a **beholder**, or another monstrous crime lord). Make sure the boss survives!      |
|  5  | The boss wants a treasure that's being held in an underground refuge the giant can't enter. Plan and execute the perfect heist.                            |
|  6  | Another group of adventurers refuses to serve the boss anymore. Find them and convince them to return, or join forces with them to topple the giant.       |

#### Financier

Armed with tremendous wealth, a giant financier pursues personal goals and interests that usually involve the acquisition of even greater wealth. Such a giant's appeal to adventurers is simply the promise of a steady salary and a luxurious lifestyle.

The archetypal giant financier is a cloud giant who constantly seeks to improve their standing in the ordning by amassing more wealth. The financier might back treasure-hunting expeditions into ancient ruins, prospecting missions to find valuable resources, or exploratory missions to map new lands or sea routes.

The Financier Assignments table suggests appropriate expeditions a giant might finance.

|  2  | Find a new route around or across inhospitable terrain such as a desert or ocean.                                                             |

|  4  | Sabotage the business of a rival giant.                                                                                                       |
|  5  | Guard a wagon or caravan hauling goods to a remote settlement of giants.                                                                      |
|  6  | Venture into a desolate wasteland to find the undiscovered ruined city at the center and identify the catastrophe that devastated the region. |

#### Seer

A giant seer is guided by visions—glimpses of possible futures, messages from a god, or whisperings of some alien consciousness—and sends adventurers into the world to fulfill whatever those visions demand. The adventurers might share the giant's faith in whatever higher power is sending the visions, or they might be skeptical of the visions but enjoy the benefits of the giant's patronage.

The archetypal giant seer is a storm giant driven by the search for signs of Annam's activity. The seer might seek out omens written in natural phenomena, manipulate world events to bring about the fulfillment of prophecies, or work to prepare the world and its peoples for an impending catastrophe of apocalyptic scale.

The Seer Assignments table suggests quests a giant seer might lay on adventurers.

#### Sovereign

A giant who rules over a settlement of other giants often needs Humanoid agents to act as emissaries to smaller peoples—and perhaps to enter locations where giants can't. Adventurers who fill such a role might do so out of loyalty to the giant sovereign, or they might be forced or bribed to serve the giant.

The archetypal giant sovereign is a fire giant who commands significant numbers of smaller folk, often including armies of Humanoids, as well as a community of giants. Adventurers in the sovereign's service might advance the giant's military, diplomatic, or clandestine goals on missions ranging from tactical assault to sabotage.

The Sovereign Assignments table lists some missions a giant sovereign might send adventurers on.

|  2  | Weaken or remove a rival to the sovereign's rule—an ambitious general, fanatical priest, or jealous sibling.                                     |
|  3  | Root out corruption or disloyalty among the giants, and eliminate their abuse of their strength to exploit the settlement's smaller inhabitants. |

|  5  | Suppress (or secretly aid) an underground rebellion among the smaller folk of the settlement.                                                    |
|  6  | While pretending to entertain visiting diplomats, try to discover their secret reason for visiting.                                              |

#### Tutor

*I have learned a great deal from several important tutors in my life. My advice is to heed those whose minds are as expansive as their deeds.*— BigbyA giant who serves as a tutor to adventurers is often an exile from giant society, dwelling by necessity or choice among smaller folk and sharing the ancient wisdom of giants with them. Often, these giants are interested in pursuing esoteric studies of their own even as they share what they have learned with their eager students.

The archetypal giant tutor is a stone giant who is convinced the surface world—the world of dreams—has important wisdom to impart, just as the gods sometimes speak through dreams. The tutor might teach stone carving, runic magic, or the histories of the giants to eager students, while sending them on missions to gather wisdom from the dreaming world.

The Tutor Assignments table presents assignments a giant tutor might give to adventurous students.

#### Warleader

A giant warleader commands a military force, typically comprising many Humanoids, some number of lesser creatures of the Giant type (such as ogres, cyclopes, and ettins), and a few giants of the ordning. Adventurers might serve such a giant as skilled mercenaries or as part of this force.

The archetypal giant warleader is a frost giant commanding a horde of fierce soldiers. Adventurers in the warleader's service might participate in mass battles or more surgical strikes.

The Warleader Assignments table provides suggested missions the giant might assign.

## Campaigns

Giants exist (or once existed) in nearly every D&D world, but in the present age, they are generally confined to the margins. If you want to feature giants more prominently in the past or present of your campaign, this section offers inspiration to help.

### A World of Giants

Your first decision in building a campaign world around the significant place of giants is whether the giants are flourishing in the present or inhabiting the ruins of their past.

#### Flourishing Giants

You might set your campaign in a world where giants still rule over smaller peoples—as Annam intended, the giants might say. This world could be the ancient past of a setting such as the Forgotten Realms or Eberron, where empires of giants thrived thousands of years ago. Or it could be a world of your own creation, perhaps one where giants have maintained an unbroken line of rule for countless generations. As you build such a world, consider these four key questions:

**How do different kinds of giants live together?** The world might have a single empire of giants where giants hold ranks based on their position in the ordning. Or several smaller realms might coexist in varying degrees of mutual hostility. Maybe storm giants have their own realm or realms, cloud giants their domains, fire giants theirs, and so on. Or there might be different realms that all include multiple kinds of giants.

**What's the place of Humanoids?** Perhaps the giants view themselves as stewards of the world, whose divinely appointed role is to protect and uplift the smaller peoples, and Humanoids live in the realms of giants as valued citizens. Or maybe Humanoids are new arrivals on the world, and the first intrepid adventurers are trying to carve out a place for their peoples in a hostile world. Humanoids might enjoy comfortable positions in some realms (particularly those ruled by cloud or storm giants) and be subjugated or hunted in other realms. Humanoids might align themselves (voluntarily or otherwise) with different giant kinds, allowing the giants of the ordning to serve as patrons or adversaries.

**What's the role of dragons?** In the Forgotten Realms and Eberron, ancient giants warred with dragons for control over the young world. Maybe in your setting, giants won a similar war, driving dragons into obscurity or even extinction. Perhaps such a war is still raging. Dragons might have their own realms alongside the nations of giants, coexisting in peace or in rising tension punctuated by occasional skirmishes. Alternatively, giants and dragons might have worked together to quash any opposition to their dominance over the world.

**What's the role of the giants' gods?** With the giants ruling the world as Annam intended, perhaps the All-Father hasn't turned his back on his children. He might be a much more active deity here, and giants might be more engaged in his worship and service. Or perhaps the giants rebuilt their ancient empire with the help of other powers, such as Elemental Evils, demon lords, or the dragon gods.

#### Shaped by Giants

You can also build a campaign that puts the focus on the world inhabited by the giants of old, which might or might not include a significant number of living giants. The core idea of such a campaign might be that giants dominate the history of the world, so they are responsible for all the ancient sites, magic, and treasures that populate your adventures.

A campaign built on this idea might have a post-apocalyptic feel, as Humanoids spread and begin to explore the ruins of a world destroyed by giants. Or the giants' empires might be an ancient mystery, totally forgotten in the modern world until an ancient site and its treasures are discovered and history is rewritten.

The dungeons and ruins adventurers explore might all be places built by giants. Some might instead be strongholds built by giants' enemies, such as underground fortresses where dwarves sheltered against giants' attacks. If exploring giant-sized dungeons is the norm, characters are likely prepared for climbing huge stairs and navigating other challenges of giant-sized locations (see *chapter 4*).

D&D worlds often assume some magic items (especially artifacts) were created in ancient times using long-forgotten techniques. You might decide such items in your campaign were made either by giants or by those who warred against giants. Magic items made by giants might magically adjust to fit smaller peoples, or skilled artisans might have learned techniques to alter these items. *Chapter 5* offers more information and suggestions concerning magic items and other treasures crafted by giants.

### Campaign Events

If you don't want to build a world that focuses on the presence or absence of giants, you can instead build a campaign around world-shaking events that are instigated by giants. *Storm King's Thunder* is an example: the events of this campaign-length adventure are set in motion by Annam's suspension of the ordning and by the scheming among the daughters of a storm giant king. Similar events might mark the start, middle, or end of a campaign as the actions of giants shake the world.

The World-Shaking Events table offers inspiration for giant-driven events that can set or alter the course of your campaign.

##### World-Shaking Events

|  8  | A small but growing number of giants believe the adventurers might be the fulfillment of an ancient prophecy that means they will bring about the return of Annam—and either the downfall or the resurgence of the giants. |

*Thousands and thousands of years we have walked these many worlds. Are we not too old and too wise for ancient grudges?*— Diancastra
### Giants and Other Ancients

In the mythic history of most D&D worlds, giants occupy a privileged place—alongside dragons—among the first sapient creatures to walk the earth. Elves and dwarves arose or arrived on most worlds later, and other peoples are generally considered by these ancient folk to be younger in terms of the history of these worlds. Considering the relationships among these ancients—both in history and in their current form—can be an interesting way to develop a campaign that prominently features giants.

#### Ancient History

The history of the giants and these other ancient peoples doesn't need to be important in your world, but it might have long-lasting implications. In the Forgotten Realms, giants and dragons sometimes nurse grudges against each other stemming from the Thousand-Year War that devastated their ancient empires millennia ago. Even for such long-lived creatures, twenty-five thousand years is a long time to hold a grudge. In your world, there might never have been conflict between giants and dragons, or they might have long ago set aside any lingering resentment. Perhaps giants and dragons banded together in ages past in a desperate effort to survive the rise of younger peoples. Or evil giants might have sided with chromatic dragons while good giants took up arms alongside metallic dragons in the long-running conflict between the children of Bahamut and the children of Tiamat.

Similarly, many D&D worlds feature an ancient history of conflict between dwarves and giants. This enmity is visible most clearly in certain magic items originally made by dwarves to be highly effective against giants (and other creatures of the Giant type): the *dwarven thrower*, *Whelm*, and the *Axe of the Dwarvish Lords*. Often this history of conflict is assumed to be simply a matter of fighting over territory, since both dwarves and giants often prefer to live in mountainous regions. But the myths told by both giants and dwarves on some worlds describe the conflict extending into the divine realms as well. The god Moradin, who is revered by many dwarves, is said to loathe the evil giant gods. But you might decide the dwarves and giants of your world have a long history of friendly relations, or that dwarves often side with good giants in opposition to the schemes and depredations of evil giants. Perhaps dwarves are frequently the subjects of giant-ruled realms in the mountains, living peaceful and prosperous lives under beneficent storm giant rulers or toiling in poverty under fire giant tyrants.

Most D&D worlds' histories don't include any particular animosity between elves and giants. Perhaps in your world, elves and giants have coexisted peacefully in separate regions of the world. Or maybe they warred fiercely: an *elven thrower* (a spear that is otherwise identical to a *dwarven thrower* warhammer) might be a magic relic of those ancient battles. Perhaps elves and giants worked together to bring an end to evil dragons' dominion over the young world, and the two peoples maintain a sense of mutual respect.

#### War of the Ancients

![When giants hold up the sky, what happens when dragons decide to make the sky fall?](img/book/BGG/045-03-009.giants-atlas.webp)

You might also decide to create a campaign where the conflicts among the ancients, like the Thousand-Year War between giants and dragons in the Forgotten Realms, are not a matter of ancient history but a present reality. You could build an entire campaign in the shadow of such a conflict, which is basically taking the ideas described under "*Clash of Titans*" earlier in this chapter and extending them through many adventures.

The war might not be a simple two-sided conflict between giants and dragons. Perhaps elves, dwarves, good giants, and metallic dragons joined forces against a two-pronged assault from evil giants and chromatic dragons. Or war might be raging between dragons and elves while giants strive to protect smaller peoples from the fallout.

Other peoples and monsters might be involved. The war might be a largely subterranean clash between stone giants and mind flayers while dwarves and drow seek to escape the earth-shaking and cavern-collapsing aftershocks of battles. Or storm giants might combat krakens and other nightmares of the deep while coastal cities and merchant ships struggle to endure devastating storms and tidal waves.

The Thousand-Year War in the Forgotten Realms lasted a thousand years for good reason: neither giants nor dragons were ever particularly numerous, and actual skirmishes between giants and dragons were rare. For this reason, you could run a campaign where battles between the warring parties are isolated events along the lines of the world-shaking events described in "*Campaign Events*." You might begin the campaign with one such battle, have the adventurers spend months or even years dealing with the aftereffects of the cataclysmic battle, then send your campaign in a new direction with a second battle. Maybe a third, truly cataclysmic battle—in which the adventurers are now high enough level to participate in the combat and turn it in favor of one side or the other—brings the campaign to a close.

### Giants of Myth

Another approach to making giants a significant part of your campaign is to feature them in the mythology of your world. *Scions of giants' gods* (see *chapter 6*) might feature prominently in these myths, as these examples illustrate.

#### Ancient Advocates

Giants stole secrets of knowledge and magic from the gods and shared them with Humanoids, thus helping the smaller folk build their first civilizations. For that crime, the giants have endured millennia of punishment at the hands of petty and vengeful gods. Some giants blame Humanoids for causing this punishment, but others still view helping and teaching smaller peoples as their responsibility. (Alternatively, maybe the giants were responsible for teaching Humanoids the evil use of magic and were justly punished for that sin.)

#### Earth Shapers

Whether it's recorded in revered myth, passed on as casual folklore, or simply fact, giants shaped the landscape in the earliest days of the world. Gigantic boulders scattered across a rolling moor weren't deposited by receding glaciers—they were dropped (or intentionally placed) by giants. A great canyon wasn't worn away by eons of erosion; it was formed when a tired giant dragged her axe behind her after a long day of hewing trees (or dragons). The basalt columns visible at low tide connecting an island to the mainland aren't the result of volcanic activity but rather the craft of ancient giants. A crater or lake might be the place where an ancient giant stepped, slept, or fell after trying to climb the stars to reach Annam's palace. Elemental magic might linger in these places, making them likely locations for dungeons or monster lairs. Carefully sifting through these tales and plotting the locations on a map might reveal the path some ancient giant walked across the land, pointing to the location of a great mystery at the beginning or end of that journey.

#### Gardens of Delight

In a world that is fundamentally inhospitable to life, giants are responsible for maintaining small areas where Humanoids can flourish. Perhaps storm and cloud giants control the weather to maintain small gardens of comfortable temperatures amid a world-spanning desert or frozen wasteland. The campaign might explore what happens to the inhabitants of one of these gardens when its giant caretaker falls ill or dies. Or the gardens might be the stuff of legend in a harsh world where the bravest explorers dare to search for them.

#### Giants Hold Up the World

Six scions of giants' gods literally hold the world together. Perhaps they're responsible for holding the continents above the ocean surface or supporting the dome of the sky, or they might keep the world together through magical means. In any case, if these titans were killed, the world would dissolve into the Elemental Chaos. (*Giants of the Worldroot Circle*, described in *chapter 2*, might be responsible for protecting these scions.)

#### The Never-Ending Saga

Though Annam granted her wish for divinity, Diancastra still roams the worlds of the Material Plane, continuing the whimsical adventures told in numerous sagas. She is a trickster figure whose curiosity, acquisitiveness, and wanderlust constantly get her into sticky situations—and whose cleverness and occasional exertion of giant strength always get her out of those situations. Though she often appears disguised as a young storm giant, she can just as easily appear as a human, elf, or gnome, making her true identity almost impossible to discern. She enjoys a variety of worldly pleasures and delights in the company of mortal creatures of all kinds. She loves to learn more spells, preferring spells of the enchantment and illusion schools.

Though her exploits seem to serve only her own desires, Diancastra does have a greater agenda: to convince Annam to emerge from his seclusion and restore the giants to their rightful place at the pinnacle of the created order. Adventurers who get caught up in her schemes might eventually have a hand in bringing about Annam's return—or preventing it!

#### The Six Sleepers

The world has six scions of giants' gods, near-divine titans who are sleeping until Annam awakens them. Their slumbering forms define the terrain features of a certain region of the world (or perhaps up to six regions if they are dispersed around the world). A prophecy suggests a means by which they might be awakened early, leading to the destruction of the world.

#### The Six-Story Mountain

At the center of the world is an enormous mountain that is the ancestral home of this world's giants. The mountain vertically embodies the ordning, from the foothills to the churning storm that perpetually roils above its sky-high peak. The giants were banished from this mountain in ancient times, and scions of giants' gods, angels, devils, or some other supernatural guardians watch over the place to make sure the giants don't return before Annam gives them leave. What secrets of the world's creation and ancient history are hidden in this mythic place?

# Chapter 4: Giant Enclaves

*When I set my mind on creating a lasting legacy, I asked Diancastra to help me find a place where I could craft an item with the power I had in mind. She brought me to the Star Forge.*— BigbyThis chapter, intended for the Dungeon Master, presents giant enclaves—locations created by giants, controlled by them, or otherwise stemming from giants and their magic. Each section contains a map of the giant enclave, a description of the enclave's features and wondrous properties, and adventure ideas.

The chapter includes the following giant enclaves:

- *Annam's Cradle*
- *Ashen Grotto*
- *Dreamer's Reach*
- *Endless Rockslide*
- *Forest Crystal*
- *Forsaken Deep*
- *Gale's Eye Tower*
- *Grolantor's Larder*
- *Hiatea's Hearth*
- *Horizon's Edge*
- *Howling Iceberg*
- *Karontor's Hold*
- *Misty Vale*
- *Runic Circle*
- *Singing Sands*
- *Star Forge*
- *Thundering Observatory*
- *Worldroot Sapling*

![](img/book/BGG/046-04-001.star-forge.webp)

## Using Enclaves

Each of the locations in this chapter is a blank slate; you can decide who lives there, what they want, and how they interact with visitors. Each location includes a selection of adventure hooks that might attract characters to the enclave or give them a reason to draw on its magic. The adventure hooks also suggest specific creatures or encounter tables appearing in the "*Encounters*" section in *chapter 3*. And several of these hooks point to other enclaves, creating paths to string locations together into larger adventures.

When developing these enclaves into adventure sites, let your imagination run wild. Mix and match different encounter tables to see what can arise. Consider how randomly determining the attitude of the creatures generated can shift the tone of a story. If a hostile giant is the driving force behind an adventure seed, how does the adventure change if that giant is indifferent or even friendly to the characters?

### Giant Enclave General Features

Locations built, repurposed, or furnished by giants have a grand scale. A giant's castle contains massive thrones, dining tables that could serve as the foundation for a human's home, and cutlery a human army could use as weapons. As a general rule, multiply each dimension of a space or object by three to estimate its giant-sized version, or by four if it's made by cloud or storm giants. Giant-sized locations have the following features:

- **Ceilings.** Comfortable ceilings for giants must exceed 20 feet at minimum. Most ceilings are 30 feet high, with luxurious or impressive construction pushing their height to 60 feet or more.
- **Doors.** Door handles are typically 10 to 12 feet off the floor (or half the height of the giants who built them). Large or smaller creatures must reach the handle to unlatch it. Opening a door typically requires one character to operate the latch and another to wrestle the door open. While the handle is unlatched, a creature must use an action to push or pull on the heavy door, opening it with a successful DC 12 Strength (Athletics) check. (Alternatively, you can set the DC to 6 + the Strength modifier of the giants who built the door.) On a failed check, the door doesn't open.
- **Oversized Furnishing and Objects.** Furnishings and other items in a location made for Huge giants are typically three times the size of human-sized equivalents and roughly twenty-seven times the weight. Medium and smaller creatures can clamber over or scuttle under giant-sized furniture, treating it as *difficult terrain*. Such creatures can move normally beneath particularly hefty pieces of giant furniture, such as a 12-foot-tall dining table.
- **Stairs.** Giant-made steps range from 1½ to 3 feet high. Large and smaller creatures treat such staircases as difficult terrain. Ladders made for giants, with rungs spaced 3 feet apart, can also be treated as difficult terrain for creatures smaller than Huge.

## Annam's Cradle

Giants from an ancient empire created an empowered form of the life rune that channeled Annam the All-Father's raw creative might. The giants sought to create their own world as he once did, and invoked the rune in an immense cavern deep underground, which they named Annam's Cradle. The result was a permanent rift in the fabric of reality leading to the Positive Plane—the source from which radiant energy flows throughout the multiverse to fuel light and life.

This rift, an incandescent slash in the cavern's "sky," is known as the Radiant Sun. It floods the vast cavern with light and unchecked life. Fed by this sun, the cavern is a sprawling tropical jungle ecosystem where massive creatures thrive.

### Annam's Cradle Features

![Map 4.1: Annam's Cradle](img/book/BGG/047-map-4.01-annams-cradle.webp)![Player Version](img/book/BGG/048-map-4.01-annams-cradle-player.webp)The Radiant Sun fluctuates in size and intensity to approximate a cycle of day and night. During the day, the rift sheds bright light that counts as sunlight, raising the temperature in the jungle to about 100 degrees Fahrenheit. At night, the light fades to dim light and doesn't count as sunlight. The cavern's ceiling is a quarter of a mile high and has the appearance of a strangely rough-looking blue sky. The microclimate within the cavern features cloudy and rainy weather in addition to sunshine.

Map 4.1 depicts a region of Annam's Cradle with the following features:

- **Jungle.** Nourished by the light of the Radiant Sun and persistent rainfall, this part of the cavern is covered in lush rain forest. The jungle is rife with natural hazards, including *razorvine* (explained in the *Dungeon Master's Guide*).
- **Ruins.** Ancient structures built by giants lie in ruins, partially swallowed by the verdant jungle.
- **Villages.** Settlements populated by giants, duergar, deep gnomes, and other creatures dot the cavern.
- **Waterfall.** A mighty river plummets down a cliff face beneath the Radiant Sun. The waterfall gleams with inner light infused by the sun, and the water flows throughout the rest of the cavern in lesser rivers and streams. The waterfall sheds dim light for 30 feet. Water downriver of the falls sheds dim light for 5 feet.

### Annam's Cradle Magic

The Radiant Sun imbues Annam's Cradle with the following properties:

- **Abundance of Life.** Creatures other than Constructs or Undead who finish a long rest within Annam's Cradle regain all expended Hit Dice and remove 2 levels of exhaustion.
- **Infused Water.** Water taken from the waterfall retains the imbued positive energy for 24 hours, during which time the water sheds dim light in a 5-foot radius. A creature that isn't a Construct or an Undead that drinks the water gains 2d10 *temporary hit points* and the benefits of a *greater restoration* spell. A creature that gains these benefits can't do so again until it finishes a long rest.
- **Planar Rift.** The Radiant Sun is a permanent, one-way portal from the Positive Plane.

### Annam's Cradle Adventures

Here are sample adventure hooks to bring characters to Annam's Cradle or to give them missions to pursue within the cavern.

#### Dreams in Stone

A great pillar of rock reaching to the cavern's ceiling is the petrified body of a primordial giant. The figure's arm stretches up, breaching the cavern ceiling, and its fingers emerge on the surface above as *Dreamer's Reach* (in this chapter). The sleeping primordial's nightmares might take the form of creatures from the *Fiendish Incursion Encounters table* or the *Giant Necropolis Encounters table* in *chapter 3*, and they crawl down the petrified form to terrorize the inhabitants of the cavern below. Or they could climb to the surface at Dreamer's Reach, leading the characters into Annam's Cradle to find their source.

The nightmares might be a once-in-a-lifetime disaster, making the adventure a matter of waiting them out and defending against the creatures that terrorize the area. Alternatively, they might recur regularly, leading characters to seek a way to end the cycle by soothing the slumbering titan's nightmares, which might require climbing its mountainous form and carving the Giant rune for "friend" into its forehead.

#### Little Fluffy Lost

A distraught giant child lost their pet and begs for help retrieving it before it comes to harm. The child leads the characters into the jungle, where they find a menacing **allosaurus**. Before any hostilities erupt, the child delightedly shouts, "Fluffy!" The allosaurus wags its tail and rolls on its back for belly rubs. However, creatures from the *Giant Kin Encounters table* in *chapter 3* have been hunting the dinosaur and close in for the kill.

#### Stricken Crown

A cursed ruler's failing health can be cured only by water taken from the cavern's central waterfall. But **hill giants** of especially immense stature led by a **hill giant avalancher** (see *chapter 6*) venerate and guzzle the waters. They violently defend the waterfall with beasts of war from the *Megafauna World Encounters* or *Dinosaur World Encounters table* in *chapter 3*.

## Ashen Grotto

The Ashen Grotto is a burial ground for giants. Since it was first established—in a long-ago age when a great empire of giants stretched across the world—giants of all kinds have brought their dead to be interred within this nexus of giants' magic.

Many giants hold strong beliefs and taboos about the grotto. Some might put aside a deadly enmity with their rivals to defend it against intruders. Others might refuse to enter for any reason other than during funerary rites to inter a family member's remains. Remains laid to rest within the grotto remain peaceful, and the power of the cave is anathema to Undead.

### Ashen Grotto Features

![Map 4.2: Ashen Grotto](img/book/BGG/049-map-4.02-ashen-grotto.webp)![Player Version](img/book/BGG/050-map-4.02-ashen-grotto-player.webp)The walls of this seaside cave of white limestone are reinforced with masonry and inscribed with verses extolling the ordning and reverence for one's ancestors. Most of the cave is above the sea's reach.

Map 4.2 depicts the Ashen Grotto's chambers and burial sites, including the following features:

- **Caskets.** Stone and crystal caskets house the remains of stone giants.
- **Coral Pool.** The bottom of a pool fed by an inlet from the sea is carpeted with storm giant bones covered in coral.
- **Frozen Skeletons.** Frost giant skeletons lie or sit propped, wearing ancient armor covered in lasting rime.
- **Hidden Tomb.** A secret door hides a repository of cloud giant dust.
- **Ossuary Pits.** Hill giant remains are heaped in pits where scavengers thrive.
- **Urns.** Brass and iron urns contain fire giant ashes.

Scattered among all these urns, caskets, and burial niches are the remains of other creatures who were loyal allies or loved ones of giants long gone, including creatures of the Giant type such as ettins and ogres, and even some Humanoids and other non-Giants.

### Ashen Grotto Magic

The Ashen Grotto's magic reinforces the ordning specifically, and the natural, harmonious order of things in general. It can be used to break curses and ease afflictions, and to find insight into that which must be returned to its rightful course. The site is consecrated ground with the following properties:

- **Bane of Undead.** Dead creatures can't become Undead in the grotto. An Undead that enters the grotto for the first time during a turn or that starts its turn there takes 22 (5d8) radiant damage. An Undead reduced to 0 hit points by this damage dies and can't be returned to its undead state by any means short of divine intervention.
- **Ordning's Path.** A creature who spends 8 hours meditating in the grotto on the nature of order and the rightful course of history can cast one of the following spells at the end of that time (no additional casting time or spell components required): *legend lore*, *greater restoration*, or *remove curse* (cast at 9th level). The spellcasting ability for the spell is the creature's choice of Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma. After casting the spell, the creature gains 2 levels of exhaustion.

### Ashen Grotto Adventures

Here are sample adventure hooks to bring characters to the Ashen Grotto or to give them missions to pursue within the cave.

#### Greedy Usurpers

Giants who wish to inter their dead in the Ashen Grotto ask the characters to help them remove a rival faction claiming it for themselves. The friendly giants respect the grotto's traditions and refuse to shed another giant's blood within, but the rivals no longer hold to tradition and seek to plunder the grotto's treasures and power. Use your choice of *Giantkind Encounters tables* in *chapter 3* for the rivals.

#### Key to the Past

A token in one of the most ancient burials is inscribed with the last surviving copy of a key rune. In the ages since its creation, the rune has become corrupted. It still functions, but it creates tears in the planar fabric. Creatures from the *Fiendish Incursion Encounters table* (see *chapter 3*) defend the rune. If this rune is inscribed in the *Runic Circle*, it opens a gateway to *Horizon's Edge* (both in this chapter).

#### Missing Pieces

A **storm giant** asks the characters to retrieve an ancestor's bone from the Coral Pool, since she is forbidden to enter the grotto. She promises them a *javelin of lightning* if they retrieve the bone, which she intends to use to make a more powerful item. A **behir** agent of a rival storm giant and creatures from the *Storm Giant Encounters table* (see *chapter 3*) try to steal the bone first.

#### Tide of Death

Fleeing from a horde comprising hundreds of **zombies** (as well as creatures from the *Death Giant Encounters* or *Giant Necropolis Encounters table* in *chapter 3*), villagers took sanctuary in the grotto but are now trapped and running out of supplies. Adventurers must disperse the horde by killing the **death giant shrouded one** (see *chapter 6*) who created it or clear a path for the villagers to escape.

## Dreamer's Reach

Dreamer's Reach is steeped in dreams. Five stone monoliths stand atop a low mound of earth, reaching toward the sky. The monoliths are the fingers of a petrified, primordial being of earth and stone. This being strove to reach the surface—what it believed to be the world of dreams—and almost succeeded: its fingers reached into the air, but then the being fell into perpetual slumber. Now the echoes of its dreams whisper to any who sleep in the vicinity.

Stone giants were the first to discover the site and its magical properties, and they built shelters in and around the mound. Dreamer's Reach draws stone giant pilgrims who seek the place for its magic, but other creatures often use the shelters for their own purposes.

### Dreamer's Reach Features

![Map 4.3: Dreamer's Reach](img/book/BGG/051-map-4.03-dreamers-reach.webp)

The mound around the stone fingers has been smoothed to a circular plateau. Giant-sized shelters are carved into the sides of the plateau, and several free-standing structures made of fitted stones surround the mound. Map 4.3 depicts Dreamer's Reach, including the following features:

- **Monoliths.** Four of the monoliths—the fingers of the primordial's outstretched hand—are arranged in an arc and stand about 30 feet tall. The fifth (the thumb) is set apart from the inner curve of the fingers and stands about 15 feet tall. Spiraling carvings and Giant runes adorn all five monoliths.
- **Shelters.** The shelters are spacious for Small or Medium creatures, but they are cozy for the stone giants who built them, with just enough room for two Huge creatures to lie down side by side.

### Dreamer's Reach Magic

A creature who falls asleep or uses a feature such as an elf's Trance trait at Dreamer's Reach can call upon the magic of the place while sleeping, activating one of the following properties:

- **Dreamer's Call.** The creature casts the *dream* spell as it sleeps, requiring no additional casting time, action, or spell components. The caster must be the spell's messenger. When the spell ends, the recipient of the spell is immune to this property for 24 hours.
- **Dreaming Intuition.** The creature casts either the *commune* or the *divination* spell as it sleeps, requiring no additional casting time, action, or spell components. The spells tap into a collective reservoir of dreams, and the answers come as dream imagery. This reservoir can answer the caster's questions if the subject has ever been dreamed of.

A creature who uses one of these properties can't use either one again for 24 hours. On waking, the creature must succeed on a DC 10 Charisma saving throw or have the charmed condition for 24 hours. A creature charmed in this way refuses to leave Dreamer's Reach and wants to use one of the site's properties the next time the creature sleeps. Each time a creature succeeds on or fails this saving throw, the save DC permanently increases by 1 for that creature.

### Dreamer's Reach Adventures

Here are sample adventure hooks to bring characters to Dreamer's Reach or to give them missions to pursue there.

#### Dreaming Key

A **cloud giant** has taken control of Dreamer's Reach, searching for the answer to a riddle that leads to the *Misty Vale* (in this chapter). The giant has hired and tricked creatures from the *Giant Kin Encounters table* (see *chapter 3*) to defend the site.

#### Plague of Nightmares

Many people suffer repeating, terrible dreams every night. A **coven of night hags** uses dozens of people at Dreamer's Reach as channels to send the nightmares. The hags use creatures from the *Hill Giant Encounters table* (see *chapter 3*) as bodyguards.

#### Royal Nightmare

A monarch is locked in nightmare-filled slumber that magic has failed to end. Characters must use Dreamer's Reach to enter the sleeper's nightmares and end them from within. Dream entities oppose the effort, taking the forms of creatures from the dreamer's life and from the *Fiendish Incursion Encounters* and *Giant Necropolis Encounters* tables in *chapter 3*.

#### Starry Beacon

A character who rests at Dreamer's Reach dreams of a brilliant star falling from the sky. Images of the dream persist upon waking and lead the character to a distinctive mountain. There, the character can use the *Star Forge* (in this chapter) to create a sentient magic item if they gather the proper materials and defeat creatures from the *Giant Construct Encounters table* (see *chapter 3*) at the forge.

#### Wakeup Call

A missing patrol's trail leads to Dreamer's Reach. The primordial's dreams charmed the patrol to join a group of **stone giants** who seek omens from the dream world. The patrol refuses to leave, and the giants and creatures from the *Stone Giant Encounters table* (see *chapter 3*) fight to keep the patrol here if necessary.

## Endless Rockslide

A perpetual cascade of stone and earth, from pebbles to boulders, begins near the peak of a mountain and tumbles down the slope before disappearing into a crevice. This Endless Rockslide originates from the Elemental Plane of Earth, emerging from a planar portal near the mountain peak and plunging through a second portal deep in the crevice, ending in a different area of the Plane of Earth.

Giants of an ancient civilization sought to harvest the rockslide's magic and endless mineral resources. To aid their work, they carved walkways around the rockslide and built stone bridges spanning the fissure it pours into. The Giant runes these folk carved into the bridges still glimmer with crystalline light as they harness elemental earth magic.

### Endless Rockslide Features

![Map 4.4: Endless Rockslide](img/book/BGG/052-map-4.04-endless-rockslide.webp)

The Endless Rockslide plunges down the mountainside with tremendous force and thunderous sound. Creatures within 100 feet of the earth slide make ability checks that require hearing with disadvantage. A creature that starts its turn in the rockslide must make a DC 20 Strength saving throw. On a failed save, the creature descends 200 feet and takes 33 (6d10) bludgeoning damage. On a successful save, it takes half as much damage and can grab a stable handhold within reach to avoid descending. After descending 1,000 feet from the rockslide's origin, the creature passes through a permanent portal to the Plane of Earth. A creature with a burrow speed can use that speed to move in the slide, has advantage on the saving throw, and takes half damage on a failed save and no damage on a successful save. A creature with the Earth Glide trait automatically succeeds on the saving throw. The source of the slide is also a permanent portal to the Plane of Earth.

Map 4.4 shows the following features surrounding the Endless Rockslide:

- **Bridges and Walkways.** Bridges carved with Binding Runes (see below) span the chasm, and walkways allow access around the rockslide. A crane and winch with buckets and sieves, installed in recent times, allow workers to gather minerals from the slide.
- **Chambers.** Giant-sized chambers are carved into the rock near the falls, including a workshop that holds tools for working metal, stone, and gems.

### Endless Rockslide Magic

The Endless Rockslide has the following properties:

- **Binding Runes.** A creature touching one of the runes on the bridge can attempt to activate it with 1 minute of concentration and a DC 20 Intelligence (Arcana) check. On a failed check, the creature takes 22 (4d10) force damage, as the bound elemental power releases explosively. On a successful check, the rune conjures an **earth elemental** that remains for 1 hour and obeys the creature. Once a creature has used this property to cast the spell, that creature can't use this property of any binding rune again until it finishes a long rest.
- **Endless Resources.** The Endless Rockslide is an inexhaustible source of minerals. A creature who spends 8 hours using appropriate tools to gather materials from the slide acquires 2d6 × 50 gp worth of useful or valuable minerals.

### Endless Rockslide Adventures

Here are sample adventure hooks to bring characters to the Endless Rockslide or to give them missions to pursue there.

#### Constructive Endeavors

Runes harnessing the elemental power of the Endless Rockslide hold the key to a **mage's** research. The mage offers a *manual of golems (clay)* in exchange for help in overcoming guardians from the *Giant Construct Encounters table* (see *chapter 3*).

#### Dangerous Beauty

Stone giant artisans find inspiration in the Endless Rockslide and create beautiful works from its material, but a **fomorian warlock of the dark** (see *chapter 6*) curses the crafts to bring misfortune. The stone giants ask the characters to find the fomorian and end the curse before they're overwhelmed with creatures drawn from the *Fomorian Encounters* and *Giant Kin Encounters* tables in *chapter 3*.

#### Greatest Game

A **frost giant** loves to hunt dangerous creatures. She intends to divert the Endless Rockslide and use its force to break open a rock formation sealing off *Annam's Cradle* (in this chapter). Opening the path frees beasts from the *Megafauna World Encounters table* (see *chapter 3*), which then threaten a settlement of deep gnomes and duergar.

#### Hungry Earth

Hungry creatures from the *Elemental Earth Encounters table* (see *chapter 3*) swarm from the Endless Rockslide, driving out the fire giants working there. The giants offer a bounty of metal craft and gems in exchange for help retaking the site.

#### Rival Elements

A **djinni** assaults the Endless Rockslide to disrupt the plans of her **dao** rival. Each genie asks the characters to side against the other. The characters face threats from the *Elemental Earth Encounters* or *Elemental Air Encounters table* in *chapter 3* as appropriate.

## Forest Crystal

A great blue crystal juts from the moss of a forest glade and pulses with soft light. The plants of the surrounding wood grow to fantastic proportions. Regardless of local weather, the glade and its surrounding forest always thrive, offering shelter and bounty to the creatures who dwell there. But this verdant region hides a dark secret.

A forgotten empire of giants used a network of crystals, including the one at the forest's heart, to shape the land to their needs. The crystals tap into the magic of the Feywild, drawing the natural energy of that realm to overlay the material landscape around them. Though the forest is real for all practical purposes, it is a magical illusion concealing a region of sinister corruption.

### Forest Crystal Features

![Map 4.5: Forest Crystal](img/book/BGG/053-map-4.05-forest-crystal.webp)

Map 4.5 depicts the forest crystal and its surrounding glade, including the following features:

- **Crystal.** The 80-foot-tall, 50-foot-wide crystal sheds dim light in a 30-foot radius. Shades of blue swirl within the crystal, occasionally resolving into murky images of giants' faces or Giant runes. The crystal radiates powerful but fluctuating magic.
- **Plants.** The plants around the crystal grow quite large and can move on their own as if sapient—often uprooting themselves to wander into the forest, keeping the glade relatively free of undergrowth.
- **Tree Dwellings.** Wooden huts with slate or thatched roofs perch in some of the larger trees around the edges of the glade.

### Forest Crystal Magic

The Forest Crystal extends a powerful magical shroud covering the surrounding region. The land surrounding the crystal within a radius of 5 miles is transformed into lush forest as if by the *mirage arcane* spell, except pieces of the forest brought outside this range don't vanish. The magic has the following additional properties:

- **Dispelling the Shroud.** A *dispel magic* spell targeting an area of the forest ends the effect in a 20-foot cube for 1 hour if the caster succeeds on a DC 20 ability check using the caster's spellcasting ability. The affected area reverts to a fetid swamp.
- **Shifting the Shroud.** A creature in the glade can take limited control of the crystal by concentrating on it for 1 hour and succeeding on a DC 25 Intelligence (Arcana) check. A creature who takes control of the crystal can end the shroud for 24 hours or change it to a different type of terrain permanently. Additional creatures beyond the first can assist in controlling the crystal. For each additional creature who concentrates for the full hour, reduce the DC of the check by 1 (to a minimum of DC 15).
- **Wild Magic.** The Feywild energy that fuels the crystal interacts unpredictably with other magic. Whenever a creature casts a spell of 1st level or higher within the glade, that creature must succeed on a DC 10 saving throw using its spellcasting ability or roll on the Wild Magic Surge table (see the "Sorcerer" section in the *Player's Handbook*).

### Forest Crystal Adventures

Here are sample adventure hooks to bring characters to the Forest Crystal or to give them missions to pursue there.

#### Lost Legacy

A **young green dragon** who lairs near the crystal approaches the characters and requests their aid. The minions of a rival dragon (creatures from the *Giant Kin Encounters table* in *chapter 3*) seek to destroy the crystal. The rival, a **young black dragon**, wishes to reclaim the swamp hidden by the crystal's magic because the swamp belonged to the dragon's ancestor.

#### Reclamation

Creatures from the *Cloud Giant Encounters table* (see *chapter 3*) assault the crystal, causing kobolds who live in the treetop huts to seek assistance. A **cloud giant destiny gambler** (see *chapter 6*) seeks to reconnect the crystal with others of its kind, including the remains of one that is now the *Singing Sands* (in this chapter). If the cloud giant is successful, the reestablished network of crystals could allow the giant to reshape great portions of the world.

#### To Cure a Kingdom

A virulent plague ravages the countryside. The only cure is a specific mushroom, but all accounts speak of it growing in a swamp that doesn't exist. The characters must use the Forest Crystal to reveal the swamp hidden beneath the magical forest. Then they must battle creatures from the *Giant Necropolis Encounters table* (see *chapter 3*) under the command of a **mummy lord** to claim the cure.

#### Urban Renewal

A circle of **druids** uses ancient magic to amplify the crystal's power, spreading its land-warping influence. The crystal's growing shroud threatens to engulf a nearby city whose ruler has been hostile to the druids in the past. Creatures from the *Megafauna World Encounters table* in *chapter 3* spontaneously arise in the city and wreak havoc as the settlement transforms.

## Forsaken Deep

The coral-covered ruins of a storm giant retreat cling to the ocean floor at the edge of an undersea trench. Storm giants once used this place as a haven to contemplate omens, to refine experimental magic, and to commune with the ocean. Its peace shattered when death giants from the Shadowfell found a lightless river that led into the trench and killed the retreat's original inhabitants.

Portions of the retreat still hold foul air, but most areas have been flooded by the cold deep. The retreat's runic circle still channels elemental power from a portal to the Plane of Water deep in the trench, and crystalline archives hold lost knowledge of the giants who built them.

### Forsaken Deep Features

![Map 4.6: Forsaken Deep](img/book/BGG/054-map-4.06-forsaken-deep.webp)![Player Version](img/book/BGG/055-map-4.06-forsaken-deep-player.webp)Map 4.6 shows the ruins of the storm giant retreat and the trench, including the following features:

- **Library.** The retreat's flooded library holds five crystalline, coral archives that contain knowledge preserved in crackling lightning. The formations are 10 feet across and 20 feet high. Two are shattered and useless, but three still spark with knowledge.
- **Meditation Chamber.** The great dome still holds the ocean at bay, but the air inside is fouled by time and rot. After each hour spent within the dome, a creature that breathes air must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature has the poisoned condition until it finishes a short or long rest in a place with fresh air. The restless spirits of the slain storm giants congregate in this chamber, harmlessly but mournfully wailing their sorrow. A circle of Giant runes on the floor hums softly (see "Storm Call" below).
- **Trench.** The oceanic trench dives into darkness (see "Planar Crossing" below).

### Forsaken Deep Magic

The Forsaken Deep has the following properties:

- **Lightning Archive.** A creature touching an archive can use an action to access the stored knowledge. Roll a d10. On a 1 or 2, the archive surges with lightning. Each creature in the room must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 22 (4d10) lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much on a successful one. If the d10 roll was 3 or higher, the creature can query the archive as by a *commune* spell. Once a creature uses the archive successfully, that creature can't do so again for 24 hours.
- **Planar Crossing.** The trench below the retreat pierces the fabric of the planes. Two rifts in the planar fabric open in the depths of the trench, one leading to the Shadowfell and the other to the Elemental Plane of Water. Sluggish currents flow from each rift, each traveling about 200 feet before they meet and well upward, 500 feet below the fortress. By swimming against the current, a creature can pass through the rift that's the current's source and enter the connected plane.
- **Storm Call.** A creature that meditates within the Meditation Chamber's rune circle for 10 minutes and succeeds on a DC 20 Intelligence (Arcana) check can create the effects of either the *control weather* spell or the *control water* spell, or both simultaneously (user's choice). The magic affects the ocean and surface above the retreat within a radius of 10 miles for up to 8 hours, requiring no concentration.

### Forsaken Deep Adventures

Here are sample adventure hooks to bring characters to the Forsaken Deep or to give them missions to pursue there.

#### Burial at Sea

Restless spirits of the storm giants who died in the Forsaken Deep create a perpetual necrotic storm on the ocean surface above. To stop it, the characters must brave creatures from the *Elemental Water Encounters* and *Giant Necropolis Encounters* tables (see *chapter 3*), retrieve the giants' remains from the deep, and inter them in the *Ashen Grotto* (in this chapter).

#### Distant Thunder

The lightning archives hold the key to gaining control of the apparatus contained in the *Thundering Observatory* (in this chapter). A **death giant reaper** (see *chapter 6*) claims the deep with minions from the *Death Giant Encounters table* in *chapter 3*, but the giant might trade this knowledge if the characters capture a **marid** thief and dispatch the marid's minions from the *Elemental Water Encounters table* (see *chapter 3*).

#### Glory of the Storm

An **empyrean** daughter of Stronmaus seeks worthy heroes to lead into the Forsaken Deep. She hopes to earn a place at her father's side by proving herself in the depths against her wicked brother and his minions from the *Fiendish Incursion Encounters* and *Storm Giant Encounters* tables (see *chapter 3*), and she promises Stronmaus's blessing to those who help her.

#### Inky Depths

A shadow-corrupted **kraken** lairs in the deep, steeping in the mingled planar energies there. It menaces ships over its waters, dragging sailors down to become **shadows**, **ghouls**, and creatures from the *Elemental Water Encounters table* (see *chapter 3*).

## Gale's Eye Tower

A tower built from a combination of stone and solidified clouds floats in the eye of a perpetual storm. The storm's intensity fluctuates, but it never dissipates completely. When it lacks a steady will to command it, the storm wanders the world.

Long ago, a cloud giant traveler built the tower as a wandering bastion against forces of chaos on the Material Plane. The traveler constructed it using a gift from the fabled Wind Dukes of Aaqa—beings of order from the Plane of Air who oppose the forces of chaos and Elemental Evil throughout the multiverse. This gift, the Labyrinth Funnel, is a conduit to the Plane of Air that fuels the tower's magic.

### Gale's Eye Tower Features

![Map 4.7: Gale's Eye Tower](img/book/BGG/056-map-4.07-gales-eye-tower.webp)

Map 4.7 depicts Gale's Eye Tower, including the following features:

- **Control Chamber.** The topmost level of the tower is covered by a roof and enclosed with unbreakable crystal windows.
- **Labyrinth Funnel.** The Labyrinth Funnel (the Wind Dukes' gift) is a permanent cyclone in the center of the control chamber. The cyclone is a cylinder of strong winds 60 feet in diameter and 60 feet high. The eye of the cyclone is a column of crushing winds, 10 feet in diameter, that forms a portal leading to the Elemental Plane of Air. A creature that enters the central column takes 110 (20d10) thunder damage and appears in the realm known as Aaqa, a shining domain of silver spires and verdant gardens atop a fertile earth mote.
- **Storm Wall.** The tower hangs suspended in the eye of a perpetual storm, surrounded by a wall of tempestuous weather (equivalent to the effect of the *wind wall* spell) about 400 feet in diameter. Beyond that wall, the storm rages.

### Gale's Eye Tower Magic

A creature within 5 feet of the Labyrinth Funnel can safely attune to it (remaining outside it) as if it were a magic item. While attuned to it and within the control chamber, the creature can control the tower's movement, control the surrounding storm, and summon creatures from the Plane of Air as follows:

- **Flying Tower.** While uncontrolled, Gale's Eye Tower drifts at an altitude of 500 feet at 8 miles per hour (80 feet per round). During its turn, a creature in the control chamber who is attuned to the Labyrinth Funnel can cause the tower to ascend or descend 100 feet, can stop the tower, or can change the tower's speed, to a maximum of 12 miles per hour (120 feet per round), in a direction of the creature's choice.
- **Perpetual Storm.** While uncontrolled, the storm surrounding the tower creates light wind and occasional rain in a 5-mile radius. Every day, there is a 10 percent chance the storm spikes in intensity to become a full thunderstorm with strong winds and heavy precipitation for 24 hours. A creature in the control chamber who is attuned to the Labyrinth Funnel can cast *control weather* (as an action) at will to change the conditions of the storm. The creature can also cast *call lightning* at will (spell save DC 17), targeting any point the creature can see under the perpetual storm regardless of range.
- **Summoned Aid.** As an action, a creature in the control chamber who is attuned to the Labyrinth Funnel can summon an **air elemental** or an **invisible stalker** that serves the summoner. The summoned creature vanishes after 1 hour or when another creature is summoned with the funnel.

### Gale's Eye Tower Adventures

Here are sample adventure hooks to bring characters to Gale's Eye Tower or to give them missions to pursue there.

#### Glorious Aerie

A group of **aarakocra** controls the tower, flying it across the countryside and assaulting servants of the cults of Elemental Evil. They have recruited creatures from the *Elemental Air Encounters table* in *chapter 3* to aid their campaign. The aarakocra know a secret method to stabilize the Labyrinth Funnel so it can be used safely as a portal.

#### Ill Winds Blow

**Frost giant** raiders are subverting the Labyrinth Funnel to connect to the *Howling Iceberg* (in this chapter). They manipulate the winds to bring the iceberg to the tower's location, but as a side effect, the perpetual storm grows more intense and ravages the surrounding countryside. Creatures from the *Frost Giant Encounters table* (see *chapter 3*) defend the tower while the giants work.

#### Silver Storm

An **adult silver dragon** took control of the tower when it drifted into her territory, and she is using its power to drive other beings from her domain. Towns in the area desperately call for help as endless storms assail them and an onslaught of creatures from the *Elemental Air Encounters table* (see *chapter 3*) terrorizes the region.

#### Touch of Chaos

An artifact cursed by the cosmic touch of chaos can be cleansed in the Labyrinth Funnel, thanks to the funnel's connection to Aaqa. But when the artifact is brought into the tower, it temporarily corrupts the Labyrinth Funnel. Demons from the *Fiendish Incursion Encounters table* (see *chapter 3*) appear in waves to thwart attempts to cleanse the artifact.

## Grolantor's Larder

In ages past, giants found a secluded valley surrounded by low hills. Blessed by nature deities or perhaps abundant energy from the Elemental Planes, the vale teems with game animals and produces an inexhaustible supply of delicious fruits and grains. The giants named it Grolantor's Larder for the god who would most appreciate its copious bounty.

Cares and sorrow melt away here, and the harshest weather beyond the valley becomes mild within its boundaries. A babbling stream feeds a sizable pond where fish thrive. Game animals graze lazily, and birds flit between the trees and brush. Those who find their way here can rarely muster the will to leave.

### Grolantor's Larder Features

![Map 4.8: Grolantor's Larder](img/book/BGG/057-map-4.08-grolantors-larder.webp)

Map 4.8 depicts Grolantor's Larder, including the following features:

- **Groves.** Fruit trees and berry bushes fill the valley, and fields of wild grains surround it.
- **Pond.** The pond brims with fish, and the cool stream that feeds it contains clear, safe water.
- **Revelers' Clearing.** The central clearing is carpeted with lush, soft grass. A great flat stone propped upon smaller boulders serves as a table that can accommodate giants.

### Grolantor's Larder Magic

The essential magic of Grolantor's Larder is the abundant growth of food-bearing plants, providing ample food for all who visit. Foraging in the grove is a simple task that requires no ability checks. With some extra effort, visitors can gather a feast of gigantic proportions, but this magic has its risks:

- **Boundless Bounty.** With 2 hours of foraging for the choicest foods, a character can gather enough magical food to furnish a *heroes' feast* spell (no other components required). A creature who receives the benefits of the spell must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature suffers uncomfortable indigestion for 12 hours. On a successful save, the creature gains the enlarge effect of the *enlarge/reduce* spell for 12 hours. Once this magical feast has been gathered, the grove can't furnish another until the next dawn.
- **Entrapping Beauty.** After each hour a creature spends in Grolantor's Larder, the creature must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or be unwilling to leave. A creature who has eaten food gathered from the grove in the last 24 hours has disadvantage on the saving throw. A creature that fails the saving throw can repeat the save after finishing a long rest.
- **Rampant Growth.** Seeds, fruits, and cuttings of food-bearing plants from Grolantor's Larder retain their magic for up to 7 days. If they are planted in that time, the plants that grow are enriched for 1 year and yield twice the normal amount of food when harvested. After 1d4 such plant samples leave the grove, this property doesn't function until the next dawn.

### Grolantor's Larder Adventures

Here are sample adventure hooks to bring characters to Grolantor's Larder or to give them missions to pursue there.

#### Ashes of War

A war-torn country's farmland was razed and burned. The farmers need seeds and plant cuttings from Grolantor's Larder to replant their fields, but monsters from the *Dinosaur World Encounters* or *Megafauna World Encounters table* (see *chapter 3*) inhabit the grove and view intruders as food.

#### Discerning Taste

The hill giant leader occupying Grolantor's Larder wants a delicacy from *Karontor's Hold* (in this chapter). He uncharacteristically offers to share wondrous food from the larder to anyone who manages to slay an **aboleth** living in flooded tunnels beneath the castle and return with its meat. Creatures from the *Fomorian Encounters table* (see *chapter 3*) stand in the adventurers' way.

#### Ravenous

**Hill giant** cultists led by a **maw of Yeenoghu** (see *chapter 6*) raid settlements close to the grove, capturing townsfolk to be the main course in a massive feast ritual. Giants, **gnolls** and creatures from the *Hill Giant Encounters table* (see *chapter 3*) stand between the captives and freedom.

#### Safe Haven

The characters travel with refugees fleeing from disaster. The survivors are exhausted and starving when they stumble upon the grove. The **unicorn** who watches the grove and her **centaur** subjects will shelter the refugees if the characters agree to slay a nearby pride of **displacer beasts** and creatures from the *Elemental Earth Encounters table* (see *chapter 3*).

#### Wayward Son

A noble seeks adventurers to find and return her son, who vanished while traveling. His route passed by Grolantor's Larder, where the missing man became entranced by the sumptuous feast. **Satyrs** and creatures from the *Cloud Giant Encounters table* in *chapter 3* entice the characters to join the feast permanently.

## Hiatea's Hearth

A stone feast hall of gigantic proportions radiates the warmth of hearth and home. The great flagstone floor, the massive throne, and the stone arch surrounding the cavernous fireplace are inscribed with runes extolling the god Hiatea and invoking her blessing upon all who shelter here.

Many dynasties of giants have claimed ownership of Hiatea's Hearth since its founding, and each one has known vast prosperity within its walls—followed by a spectacular fall. The magic of the hall invokes Hiatea's aspect as a tender of the hearth, but it also carries a curse laid by her brother Karontor. Whoever sits upon the throne brings fortune and glory to their people, but this prosperity is short-lived, lasting only until another supplants them.

### Hiatea's Hearth Features

![Map 4.9: Hiatea's Hearth](img/book/BGG/058-map-4.09-hiateas-hearth.webp)![Player Version](img/book/BGG/059-map-4.09-hiateas-hearth-player.webp)Map 4.9 depicts Hiatea's Hearth, including the following features:

- **Feast Tables.** Several giant-sized tables carved from whole tree trunks run the length of the hall.
- **Hearth.** An enormous fireplace holds iron spits, pots, and kettles within. Inscribed on the stone arch surrounding the fireplace are Giant runes.
- **Throne.** An immense granite throne stands at the head of the hall. It is intricately decorated with stylized figures of giants and beasts, as well as more Giant runes.

### Hiatea's Hearth Magic

Hiatea's Hearth carries Hiatea's blessing as well as the curse of Karontor, giving it the following properties:

- **Hiatea's Blessing.** Hiatea's Hearth is consecrated ground. A creature in the hall that has the Channel Divinity class feature and worships Hiatea can use that feature once without expending a use of it. Once a creature benefits from this property, the creature can't do so again until it finishes a long rest.
- **Prosperity.** A creature can attune to the hall's throne as if it were a magic item. While the attuned creature sits on the throne, the creature's Charisma score becomes 25. While a creature is attuned to the throne, whether it sits there or not, any creature that finishes a short rest within Hiatea's Hearth removes 1 level of exhaustion and regains hit points as if the creature spent 2 Hit Dice without actually expending them. A creature's attunement to the throne can't end while the creature lives, and no other creature can attune to the throne until the attunement ends.
- **What Rises Must Fall.** The creature attuned to the throne has disadvantage on Wisdom checks, initiative rolls, and death saving throws. Any creatures friendly to the creature attuned to the throne have the same disadvantage while within Hiatea's Hearth.

### Hiatea's Hearth Adventures

Here are sample adventure hooks to bring characters to Hiatea's Hearth or to give them missions to pursue there.

#### Dying Embers

An **efreeti** who claimed the throne has fought off several attempts to wrest Hiatea's Hearth away. In studying the hall's history, the efreeti realized the truth of the hall's curse. She is desperate to escape her fate and offers a handsome reward, including a suit of *plate armor of resistance (fire)*, to anyone who helps her survive the impending assault of creatures from the *Storm Giant Encounters table* in *chapter 3*.

#### Ghosts of the Past

Creatures from the *Giant Kin Encounters table* (see *chapter 3*) have taken control of the hall but are plagued by restless spirits. The **ghosts** and **wraiths** of defeated foes, along with creatures from the *Giant Necropolis Encounters table* (see *chapter 3*), refuse to rest in peace.

#### Head to Head to Head

Two rival factions of giant kin vie to claim the throne. An **ettin** and a **fensir skirmisher** (see *chapter 6*) each entice the characters to side with them and their followers from the *Giant Kin Encounters table* (see *chapter 3*) to break the stalemate, offering treasure and aid in the characters' endeavors.

#### Infernal Bargain

A **bone devil** knows the power of Hiatea's Hearth and is tempting a **fire giant** to claim the throne, but the giant's wife knows the throne's curse will mean her love's certain doom. She begs adventurers to help her thwart the devil's designs, because she can't take on the devil's minions (from the *Fiendish Incursion Encounters table* in *chapter 3*) alone.

#### Turn of the Dynasty

The **stone giant** thane who controls Hiatea's Hearth fears their dynasty ending and seeks an alliance with the giants at the *Endless Rockslide* (in this chapter), but the giants there are plotting the thane's downfall. Choose any of the *encounter tables* in *chapter 3* to determine who controls the Endless Rockslide.

## Horizon's Edge

Horizon's Edge is a demiplane refuge that drifts in the roiling fog of the Deep Ethereal plane, beyond a shimmering, golden ethereal curtain. The demiplane is a serene bubble of air dotted with floating platforms of stone supporting enormous structures.

An ancient empire of giants achieved magical and technological advances that outshine those of the present age: spanning worlds and planes, building cyclopean monuments and intricate art, and wielding magic of almost unimaginable power. As this mighty empire neared its collapse, its greatest mages created Horizon's Edge to preserve some of the glories of their civilization. The demiplane might still hold secrets lost to the rest of the multiverse, including tools and devices that fuse magical and technological techniques.

### Horizon's Edge Features

![Map 4.10: Horizon's Edge](img/book/BGG/060-map-4.10-horizons-edge.webp)

Map 4.10 depicts Horizon's Edge, including the following features:

- **Building Platforms.** Massive plates made of meticulously fitted stones form patches of solid ground upon which giant-sized structures are built.
- **Rune Ring.** A great ring of glowing Giant runes slowly rotates around the equator of the spherical demiplane. A creature who studies the runes and succeeds on a DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check realizes their rotation marks out repeating 12-hour cycles, allowing visitors to keep time with the Material Plane worlds they came from.
- **Transport Disks.** Inlaid near one edge of each platform is a distinct 20-foot-diameter magical disk of intricately woven copper, iron, and silver. A creature standing on one of these disks can use an action to manipulate sliding portions of the disk and designate a destination platform. If the creature succeeds on a DC 20 Intelligence (Arcana) check, the disk flies at a speed of 60 feet to the destination, where it hovers for 1 minute or until no more creatures or objects are on it, then returns to its original position. A creature who succeeds on this check automatically succeeds on future attempts to fly any disk to the same destination.

### Horizon's Edge Magic

In contrast to the other locations described in this chapter, Horizon's Edge is notable more for the magic and technology it contains than for any magic inherent to the site itself. However, the magically created demiplane has one peculiar property:

- **Looped Gravity.** The outer boundary of the demiplane warps space. Anything that falls without being arrested passes through the bottom of the bubble. It then reappears at the top directly above that point and continues plummeting until something arrests its fall.

>Entering Horizon's Edge
>
>The lost giant empire left puzzle cubes scattered across the Material and Inner Planes, and these cubes are among the few ways to enter Horizon's Edge. A *Horizon puzzle cube* is an 8-inch magical cube made of gold, iron, crystal, and copper, and it is worth 5,000 gp to a sage or collector. A functioning puzzle cube can be solved with 30 minutes of work and a successful DC 25 Intelligence (Investigation) check. When the cube is solved, a 30-foot-diameter portal appears before the creature who solved the cube, leading to the northeastern platform of Horizon's Edge. The portal is two-way and remains open for 10 minutes or until a creature uses an action to change the puzzle's configuration. Puzzle cubes don't function while on Horizon's Edge, but a device somewhere in the demiplane allows a cube to function in reverse while the cube is fitted into it.
>
>Without a puzzle cube, the *plane shift* spell can reach the demiplane, but the specifications for the tuning fork necessary for the spell to access the plane are lost. A trek through the Deep Ethereal might reveal the single ethereal curtain that reaches the demiplane.
>

### Horizon's Edge Adventures

Here are sample adventure hooks to bring characters to Horizon's Edge or to give them missions to pursue there.

#### Key to the Past

Archaeologists hire the characters to help operate a *Horizon puzzle cube* (see the "*Entering Horizon's Edge*" sidebar) and protect them from any hazards in the demiplane. Creatures from the *Fiendish Incursion Encounters table* in *chapter 3* are trapped in the realm and attack the expedition, seeking a means of escape.

#### Reforged in Starlight

Pieces of a broken magic item found in the demiplane and guarded by creatures from the *Giant Construct Encounters table* (see *chapter 3*) still hold lingering traces of magic. Every attempt to repair the item fails. A platinum tablet refers to the *Star Forge* (in this chapter) as the place where the item was created and suggests the forge is the only place it can be repaired.

#### Scourge of Demons

A storm giant learned the ancient giants' empire collapsed due to demonic corruption, and she vowed to destroy every remnant of that corruption. She offers fantastic rewards to heroes who will venture to Horizon's Edge and rid it of creatures from the *Fiendish Incursion Encounters table* in *chapter 3*.

## Howling Iceberg

The Howling Iceberg is a massive chunk of glacial ice, sapphire blue where the light refracts and gleaming white where it reflects. The iceberg is riddled with convoluted tunnels through which perpetual winds howl. It was created by frost giant cultists of the demon lord **Kostchtchie** around a sliver of ice from the Frostfell, the Plane of Ice that forms the border between the Elemental Planes of Air and Water. The iceberg never melts, and its perpetual winds blow from the planes, carrying the biting cold of the Frostfell and the torturous howls of Pandemonium.

### Howling Iceberg Features

![Map 4.11: Howling Iceberg](img/book/BGG/061-map-4.11-howling-iceberg.webp)![Player Version](img/book/BGG/062-map-4.11-howling-iceberg-player.webp)Map 4.11 shows the Howling Iceberg, which has the following features:

- **Biting Winds.** The area within 500 feet of the Howling Iceberg is always extreme cold, and strong winds blow throughout that area in the direction of the iceberg's movement. When undirected, the iceberg drifts up to 4 miles per hour (40 feet per round) with the tide and winds.
- **Longhouse (A).** An ancient, weathered longhouse sits on a flat plain of ice and snow. Trophy hides and horns of monsters decorate the walls and roof of this structure.
- **Tunnels.** Openings in the ice lead to twisting tunnels, some naturally formed by wind and water, others tooled and cut, and still others melted by great heat. A creature who finishes a long rest in the tunnels must succeed on a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw or gain 1 level of exhaustion from the howling winds wearing down the creature's mind.

### Howling Iceberg Magic

The tunnels in the Howling Iceberg twist deeper than should be possible. A creature exploring the tunnels can make a DC 20 Wisdom (Perception or Survival) check after each hour. A creature that succeeds on three checks in a row or that rolls a 20 on the d20 finds a special destination, as shown on the Howling Iceberg Tunnels table.

##### Howling Iceberg Tunnels
|  d10 | Destination                                |
|:----:|--------------------------------------------|
|  1–4 | A planar portal leading to the Frostfell   |
|  5–8 | A planar portal leading to Pandemonium     |
| 9–10 | The cavern where the Frostfell Shard rests |

A creature who finds the Frostfell Shard can attune to it as if it were a magic item. If the creature finishes a long rest more than 1 mile from the iceberg, the creature's attunement to the shard ends. The shard can't be moved. Attunement to the shard gives the following benefits:

- **Howling Wind.** While on the Howling Iceberg, a creature attuned to the shard who doesn't have the incapacitated condition can direct the winds to howl and propel the iceberg up to 8 miles per hour (80 feet per round) in a direction of the creature's choice. The iceberg continues this movement until the attuned creature changes the direction and speed or the creature's attunement ends.
- **Planar Tunnels.** A creature attuned to the shard can navigate the tunnels within the iceberg to reach any desired destination in 1 hour without making an ability check. The creature is also immune to the exhausting effects of the howling winds in the tunnels.
- **Spellcasting.** While on the Howling Iceberg, a creature attuned to the shard can cast the *control weather* (to lower the temperature and manipulate wind only), *cone of cold*, *fear*, and *gust of wind* spells (spell save DC 17), requiring no material components. Once the creature uses this property to cast a spell, the creature can't cast that spell with the property again until it finishes a long rest.
- **Weather Resistance.** A creature attuned to the iceberg's shard is resistant to cold damage and immune to the effects of strong wind.

The Frostfell Shard can be destroyed by dealing at least 75 fire damage to it in a single turn, whereupon it melts and the iceberg shatters.

### Howling Iceberg Adventures

Here are sample adventure hooks to bring characters to the Howling Iceberg or to give them missions to pursue there.

#### Frigid Depths

A horde of **merrow** and **sahuagin** use the iceberg to raid coastal settlements and shipping lanes, commanding creatures from the *Elemental Air Encounters* and *Elemental Water Encounters* tables in *chapter 3*.

#### On Ice

A pair of **remorhazes** and creatures from the *Frost Giant Encounters table* leave the iceberg when it drifts ashore, hunting local animals and people. They drag many captives to the iceberg to store for future meals.

#### Winds of Chaos

A **death slaad** leading other slaadi emerges from the portal to Pandemonium. Along with creatures from the *Fiendish Incursion Encounters table* (see *chapter 3*), all driven wild by the winds, they maraud nearby settlements.

## Karontor's Hold

Karontor's Hold is a small keep (by giant standards) that stands on a lonely rock bluff. The approach is disorienting: the keep seems closer—or sometimes farther—than it actually is. Creatures that sleep in the vicinity find their rest plagued by disturbing dreams and unintelligible whispers that hint at something simultaneously enticing and repulsive.

Beneath the keep is a well that once held a portal to the Feywild. Ancient fomorians built Karontor's Hold around the font to study and harness its power. They used this crossing to launch an ill-fated assault on the Feywild. When the offending fomorians were exiled to the Underdark, the well's magic was twisted into a connection to the alien Far Realm.

### Karontor's Hold Features

![Map 4.12: Karontor's Hold](img/book/BGG/063-map-4.12-karontors-hold.webp)![Player Version](img/book/BGG/064-map-4.12-karontors-hold-player.webp)Map 4.12 shows Karontor's Hold, including the following features:

- **Far Realm Distortion.** The physical structure of the hold is warped near and above the well. Within this area, glistening stone flows like viscous liquid, sickly purplish radiance gleams at the edge of perception, and the air has an acrid taste.
- **Throne Room.** Damaged bas-reliefs on the walls of the crumbling throne room depict **fomorian nobles** (see *chapter 6*) passing through a portal, girded for battle. The next scene, presumably the aftermath, is defaced and illegible.
- **Well.** A giant-sized well in the keep's deepest level plunges a seemingly infinite depth. Faint purple light shines from the depths, and psychic whispers caress the mind of anyone who peers into the depths. A 5-foot-high wall surrounds the well.

### Karontor's Hold Magic

The Far Realm intrusion flowing from the well in Karontor's Hold twists space and time in and around the keep to a range of 6 miles. The enclave has the following properties:

- **Dilated Time.** The Far Realm distortion in Karontor's Hold warps creatures' perception of time in stressful situations. At the start of each creature's turn in combat, roll a d4. On an even number, the creature's speed is halved until the end of the turn. On an odd number, the creature's speed is doubled until the end of the turn. Aberrations and creatures with a psychic gift from the Psychic Well (see below) are immune to this effect.
- **Psychic Well.** A creature can try to harness the psychic power of the well by gazing into it for 1 minute while remaining within 10 feet of the well. At the end of the minute, the creature must make a DC 15 Intelligence saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 22 (4d10) psychic damage and gains 1 level of exhaustion. On a successful save, the creature gains a psychic gift of its choice: either the ability to cast the *dimension door* spell requiring no spell components, or the use of a **mind flayer's** Mind Blast action. The psychic gift fades when the creature uses it, or if it tries to harness the well again. While this psychic gift is available, the creature also gains telepathy to a range of 30 feet (as described in the *Monster Manual*). Once a creature attempts to harness the power of the well, the creature can't do so again until it finishes a long rest.
- **Twisted Space.** Roll a d4 when creatures travel within 6 miles of the keep. On a 1, the creatures travel normally. On a 2 or a 4, distance stretches and the journey takes longer than it should; multiply the distance creatures have to travel by the number rolled. On a 3, distance constricts and the journey is faster; divide the distance by 3. Roll once for creatures traveling as a group. This effect ends once creatures enter the keep or get farther than 6 miles from it.

### Karontor's Hold Adventures

Here are sample adventure hooks to bring characters to Karontor's Hold or to give them missions to pursue there.

#### Amplified Intrusion

A **fomorian deep crawler** (see *chapter 6*) lurking in the hold has designs on the *Forest Crystal* (in this chapter), seeking to corrupt it and use its magic to spread the Far Realm intrusion. While some of its minions—creatures from the *Fomorian Encounters table* (see *chapter 3*)—defend Karontor's Hold, others carry cursed objects into the forest to infuse their corruption into the crystal. If these minions are successful, the Forest Crystal becomes an extension of the Far Realm's intrusion.

#### Fallen Storm

A **storm giant** who sought to cleanse the Far Realm corruption from the keep has succumbed to the corruption and now gathers creatures from the *Giant Kin Encounters table* in *chapter 3* to unleash on surrounding settlements. The giant can be cleansed of Far Realm influence by the *remove curse* or *greater restoration* spell, but only if the spell is cast while the giant has the incapacitated condition and the caster succeeds on a DC 20 ability check using the caster's spellcasting ability.

#### Food for Thought

A colony of **mind flayers** flooded the well room with brine, and they are collecting brains to feed a nascent **elder brain**. They send dominated creatures from the *Hill Giant Encounters table* in *chapter 3* to fetch victims. An ally of the characters survives the assault and asks the characters for help.

## Misty Vale

The Misty Vale is a remote mountain valley that exists simultaneously in many places across different worlds of the Material Plane. Aside from the perpetual fog that encloses it, the valley looks much like any other at first glance. A closer investigation reveals its anomalies: terrain features and structures in the valley that don't make sense, many of which change from one visit to the next.

Cloud giant sorcerers from an ancient empire of giants combined their might to turn a mountain into a vanishing fortress, but they weren't fully successful. The mountain vanished, as did everyone and everything on it, and in its place is the Misty Vale. The fabric of the Material Plane is tangled and torn where the mountain once stood, so the valley links multiple worlds together. Because of the unpredictable nature of this tangle in space, bizarre events surround the Misty Vale as creatures, objects, and entire settlements shift—in whole or in part—from one world to another, unmoored from their proper place in reality.

### Misty Vale Features

![Map 4.13: Misty Vale](img/book/BGG/065-map-4.13-misty-vale.webp)

Map 4.13 shows the Misty Vale, including the following features:

- **Foggy Border.** The edges of the valley are *heavily obscured* by fog, which thins to *lightly obscuring* mist in the valley itself.
- **Grounded Boat.** A riverboat rests on a grassy hill, canted to one side. There is no water anywhere near it and no sign of it being dragged.
- **Misty Canyon.** Gravel-choked, fog-shrouded ravines lead to and from the vale.
- **Partial Village.** Some houses in this village are intact and others only partially present, as if they were sliced in half and set down gently in their current place. The interiors are perfectly in order, as if the human-sized occupants walked away moments ago.

### Misty Vale Magic

The Misty Vale has the following properties:

- **Guardian.** A creature known as "the guardian" is the only being that can control the Misty Vale's movements and connections among worlds. The guardian's exact form is unknown and changes from encounter to encounter, but its alignment is always chaotic neutral, its Intelligence is at least 16, and it speaks both Common and Giant. You can roll on any *encounter table* in *chapter 3* to determine the guardian's current form. If the guardian dies, it re-forms in a new guise at the next dawn. A creature can convince the guardian to grant safe passage to virtually any location on the Material Plane by one of three methods: answering a riddle posed by the guardian, offering a valuable gift such as a magic item or a secret to the guardian, or verbal argument. The last option requires a successful DC 25 Charisma (Persuasion) check.
- **Multiversal.** The Misty Vale connects to other places on the world and to different worlds of the Material Plane. The surrounding fog acts as a portal when the valley connects to a new place, allowing two-way travel.
- **Shrouded Presence.** Divination spells cast from outside the vale can't target anything in the valley or reveal information about it. Trying to navigate the dense fog into or out of the valley without the aid of the guardian requires 1 hour of travel and a DC 20 group Wisdom (Survival) check. On a successful check, the group finds its way to or from the valley. On a failed check, the travelers wander the foggy terrain for 1 additional hour before they can repeat the check.

### Misty Vale Adventures

Here are sample adventure hooks to bring characters to the Misty Vale or to give them missions to pursue there.

#### Hospitality

A community of **commoners** living in the vale offers the characters hospitality, perhaps while the characters are traveling and lost in fog. If the characters spend the night in the village, they find the valley connected to a different place in the morning, and the villagers have transformed into murderous creatures from the *Fiendish Incursion Encounters table* in *chapter 3*.

#### Price of Passage

The guardian of the vale (appearing as an **androsphinx**) demands a golden apple from *Grolantor's Larder* (in this chapter) in exchange for safe passage to a destination of the characters' choice. At the larder, a **hill giant avalancher** (see *chapter 6*) hoards three golden apples, which act as *potions of heroism*, and leads a band from the *Hill Giant Encounters table* in *chapter 3*.

#### Unexpected Hunger

Hill giant raiders stumbled into answering the guardian's riddle by coincidentally having the answer in one of their bags—a live sheep—and they now raid targets through the valley's mists. Creatures from the *Hill Giant Encounters table* (see *chapter 3*) appear in places they shouldn't, raid for food and treasure, and then vanish into the valley.

## Runic Circle

The Runic Circle combines the functions of a giant's spellbook, an astronomical chart, and a beacon to travelers beyond the stars. The ancient giants who created the circle traveled to distant lands and other worlds. Those who stayed behind used the circle to maintain communication with explorers, helping them pilot their flying ships home.

Standing stones form a great circle inscribed into a flat stone hilltop. The stones bear Giant runes, carved constellations, and strange symbols. On the ground, an enormous circle of Giant runes of power links the monoliths and circumscribes smaller circles of runes. Carved lines throughout the circle link different strings of symbols.

### Runic Circle Features

![Map 4.14: Runic Circle](img/book/BGG/066-map-4.14-runic-circle.webp)

Map 4.14 depicts the Runic Circle, including the following features:

- **Carvings.** The carvings are a combination of Giant runes of power, magical formulas like those in a wizard's spellbook, and extremely accurate charts of stars and other bodies in the sky.
- **Shelters.** Simple shelters of tight-fitted stone, just large enough to hold a single giant, dot the area around the hill. Most are partially reclaimed by nature, but some have been maintained.
- **Standing Stones.** The outer circle is formed of 40-foot-tall stone monoliths that bear constellation carvings and Giant runes of power. At night, the star carvings shed dim light for 10 feet.

### Runic Circle Magic

The Runic Circle has the following properties:

- **Magic Archive.** The inscribed runes make up a gigantic archive of spells. With 1 hour of study, a creature that is capable of casting spells can try to decipher a spell coded in the carvings. The spell is subject to your approval and must belong to the conjuration, divination, or evocation school. If the creature has spell slots of the appropriate level and succeeds on an Intelligence (Arcana) check with a DC equal to 10 + the desired spell's level, the creature can cast the spell immediately without expending a spell slot. A character that is a wizard can copy the spell into the character's *spellbook* following the usual procedure, but must do so within 24 hours, or the character must repeat the hour of study to try again.
- **Star Port.** The largest circle of runes is a permanent teleportation circle. Additionally, at night, a character can spend 10 minutes tracing constellation carvings that match the stars visible in the sky to cast the *sending* spell from the circle. If the target is on the Material, Astral, or Ethereal Plane, there is no chance the message doesn't arrive, and the recipient knows the direction to the Runic Circle until it finishes a long rest. Targets on other worlds of the Material Plane might perceive the direction as nonsense, such as in the sky, in the ground, or in a direction that doesn't correspond to three-dimensional space.

### Runic Circle Adventures

Here are sample adventure hooks to bring characters to the Runic Circle or to give them missions to pursue there.

#### Falling Feud

Two flying ships crash at the Runic Circle, appearing as a great fireball blazing through the night sky. Characters who investigate this celestial event find **mind flayers** skirmishing with **githyanki warriors** and a **githyanki knight** amid the wreckage of their vessels. Both sides are desperate and offer rewards to the characters for their help.

#### Far-Flung Invaders

Creatures from another world appear in the circle during a stellar conjunction, then attack the surrounding area. The invaders might be creatures from the *Fiendish Incursion Encounters table* or *Dinosaur World Encounters table* in *chapter 3*, or they could be other creatures of your choice. Waves of invaders appear throughout the night, unless the characters can activate the proper sequences of runes and star carvings to sever the invaders' connection to the circle.

#### Missing Coordinates

Characters in search of a crucial secret at the circle find the sequence of star charts they need is damaged. The only place the charts still exist is in the *Forsaken Deep* (in this chapter), in recorded storm giant prophecies. **Mind flayers** and their dominated minions from the *Fomorian Encounters table* (see *chapter 3*) race the characters to the prize.

#### Shipyard

A **fire giant** shipwright is studying the records in the circle with her apprentices and minions from the *Fire Giant Encounters table* (see *chapter 3*), puzzling out the secret of creating the flying ships used by the civilization that built the circle. She demands tribute in the form of magical metal treasure to allow the characters to access the circle. She also accepts a fragment from the core of a supposedly inert **runic colossus** (see *chapter 6*).

## Singing Sands

A patch of glittering, powdered crystal melodically chimes as the desert wind blows it in small, rolling dunes. The Singing Sands shine like diamonds in the harsh desert sun, soaking up light and heat as their lonely song echoes through the wastes. At night the song goes quiet, and the sands rise into a solid memory of a simple, giant-created fort.

The Singing Sands were once a single object, a massive crystal created by a lost empire of giants (similar to the *Forest Crystal* in this chapter). The crystal's function is lost to time, but it was part of a network of such devices and was protected by a small fortress. The sand takes on the fortress' shape at night, crystallizing into the memory of its former home.

*Oh, I could sing you such tales of the Singing Crystal, before it crumbled to sand. But you would weep forever.*— Diancastra
### Singing Sands Features

![Map 4.15: Singing Sands](img/book/BGG/067-map-4.15-singing-sands.webp)![Player Version](img/book/BGG/068-map-4.15-singing-sands-player.webp)During the day, the Singing Sands consist of two small dunes of gleaming, crystalline sand. The wind blows the sand across the desert at 1 mile per hour (10 feet per round). It reflects the sun and shines brightly, imposing disadvantage on attack rolls and on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight within 50 feet of them. As the sand moves, its melodious chimes are audible to 1 mile away. When a creature moves through the sand, the chiming becomes a discordant shriek.

Map 4.15 depicts the Singing Sands at night, when the sand forms a glowing, warm shelter. The construction matches a giant's proportions, but the architectural style is familiar only from ancient ruins. The temperature inside the fortress is always comfortable.

### Singing Sands Magic

The Singing Sands don't just make music; creatures can use music to shape the sand to their will. As an action, a creature can sing or play music to magically shape the Singing Sands into physical objects as it desires. If the creature succeeds on a DC 10 Charisma (Performance) check, the creature can form up to a 5-foot cube of the sand into any shape. The resulting object is made of sparkling, crystalline sand and lasts for 1 hour. For every 5 by which the creature exceeds the DC, the creature can either shape an additional 5-foot cube or increase the duration by 1 hour. Alternatively, the creature can create a permanent crystal version of a simple or martial melee weapon with the light property, or a crystal version of an object worth up to 10 gp from the *Adventuring Gear table* in the *Player's Handbook*. Once a creature shapes a permanent object from the sand, the creature can't do so again until it finishes 1d4 long rests.

### Singing Sands Adventures

Here are sample adventure hooks to bring characters to the Singing Sands or to give them missions to pursue there.

#### Desert Dreams

**Goliath giant-kin** escort a nervous **stone giant rockspeaker** (both in *chapter 6*) who needs to commune with his dreams within the crystal sand fortress at night. While he does, creatures from the *Fiendish Incursion Encounters* and *Elemental Earth Encounters* tables in *chapter 3* manifest from the sand and attack.

#### Lingering Ties

A flock of **giant vultures** follows the Singing Sands through the day, circling over creatures who investigate it. After dark, creatures from the *Giant Necropolis Encounters table* (see *chapter 3*) burst from the sand and attack anyone in the fortress. The vultures pick off stragglers and feast on the fallen. The creatures that emerge from the sand come from a lost city that holds an intact crystal like the one the Singing Sands once was, and the magical connection between the crystals endures.

#### Living Sands

Settlements along a fertile river in the desert are attacked by **purple worms** made of crystalline sand. Tales told by the locals lead to the Singing Sands, where hostile creatures from the *Megafauna World Encounters tables* (see *chapter 3*) appear, but the creatures are made of sand.

#### Searching for the Key

A lost group of **hill giants** spotted the Singing Sands and followed them into the desert. The giants know they can sing to make the sand do what they want, but none of them can carry a tune, so they're frustrated and ready to smash intruders to pieces.

#### Wanderer's Hope

A **cloud giant** in an airship seeks the Singing Sands, claiming the desert was once the seat of a powerful empire of giants. The giant wants the characters to distract creatures from the *Elemental Fire Encounters table* (see *chapter 3*) defending the sand. The giant hopes to use the sand to create a compass to locate *Gale's Eye Tower* (in this chapter).

## Star Forge

The Star Forge blazes on a small obsidian island in a lake formed in the crater where a star fell to earth. The Forge's incandescent iron furnace spills light across the dark glass and still water, casting long shadows toward the slopes of the crater.

The star fell ages ago, devastating the surrounding land. Giants of a now-vanished empire found the star in a cradle of obsidian and built the iron forge around it to channel its power into their craft.

### Star Forge Features

![Map 4.16: Star Forge](img/book/BGG/069-map-4.16-star-forge.webp)

Map 4.16 shows the Star Forge, including the following features:

- **Furnace.** The forge itself is a great housing of iron. Pipes extend from a central vessel, channeling the radiance of the forge into a vent so bright it's painful to look at. Giant runes etched on the iron flare with white light. The Star Forge sheds bright light for 100 feet and dim light for another 100 feet. An Undead that starts its turn in the bright light takes 3 (1d6) radiant damage. On a clear night, the light is visible for 300 miles.
- **Shelters.** Iron and stone dwellings dot the shore, some collapsed, others carefully maintained.
- **Bridge Remnant.** An iron bridge once spanned the water from the lakeshore to the island. Now rusted iron pilings are all that remain.

### Star Forge Magic

A creature with proficiency in appropriate artisan's tools can use the Star Forge to create magic items using those tools and an amount of materials based on the item's rarity. For every 8 hours of work, the creature can make an Intelligence check using its tool proficiency, with a DC set by the item's rarity. On a successful check, the creature makes 100 gp worth of progress. On a failed check, no progress is made. For every 10 by which the check exceeds the DC, the creature makes an additional 100 gp of progress. The item is complete when the progress equals the cost of materials for the item. See the Star Forge Item Creation table for item rarity, cost, and check DC.

##### Star Forge Item Creation
| Rarity    | Material Cost | Check DC |
|-----------|--------------:|---------:|
| Common    |        100 gp |       10 |
| Uncommon  |        500 gp |       15 |
| Rare      |      5,000 gp |       20 |
| Very Rare |     50,000 gp |       25 |
| Legendary |    500,000 gp |       30 |

Additionally, a creature that works material in the workshop area can use the forge to cast the *fabricate* spell requiring no spell components. Once this property has been used, it can't be used again until the next dawn.

### Star Forge Adventures

Here are sample adventure hooks to bring characters to the Star Forge or to give them missions to pursue there.

#### A Star Is Reborn

Thieves damaged the Giant runes stabilizing the Star Forge, and the fallen star at the forge's heart is regaining its former magnitude. As the star's power grows, frequent earthquakes release creatures from the *Elemental Earth Encounters* and *Elemental Fire Encounters* tables (see *chapter 3*) into the surrounding area. Unless the runes are repaired, the star threatens to consume the region—or perhaps the whole world.

#### Forging a Throne

A dwarf smith hopes to use the Star Forge to create a crown that will end a war of succession in their clan, but they need protection to reach the forge and finish their work. The forge is protected by an **iron golem** fueled by radiant energy and other creatures from the *Giant Construct Encounters table* in *chapter 3*.

#### Guiding Whispers

A voice whispers into a character's dreams, leading the character toward the Star Forge. The voice offers instructions for creating a fantastic magic item, but creatures from the *Giant Necropolis Encounters table* (see *chapter 3*) desperately oppose the work.

#### Magnum Opus

A **fire giant** forge master is close to creating their greatest work, a **runic colossus** (see *chapter 6*), but they lack a crucial component. If the characters find the *Singing Sands* (in this chapter), evade or destroy the sand's guardians from the *Giant Construct Encounters table* (see *chapter 3*), and fill a vial with the magical sand, the giant helps them create a sentient magic item.

#### Ravenous Star

An **azer** begs the characters for help. Other azers at the Star Forge are forced to work for an **aboleth** that claims to be a scion of a living star, Hadar the Dark Hunger. The azers' work supplies the aboleth's minions from the *Fomorian Encounters table* (see *chapter 3*) with formidable weapons and armor.

## Thundering Observatory

A gigantic turret of stone and crystal hangs in the sky, suspended between two breathtakingly tall mountain peaks by twin tethers of rumbling lightning. The light and rolling thunder herald the location's existence for many miles, though it's so remote that only a handful of people have ever seen it, and fewer still have explored it.

The few people who have managed to enter and explore the Thundering Observatory have thus far discovered only its remote viewing potential and not the full truth of the suspended turret. Most creatures can't comfortably remain in the turret long enough to puzzle out its true purpose as a doomsday weapon built by a lost empire of giants.

### Thundering Observatory Features

![Map 4.17: Thundering Observatory](img/book/BGG/070-map-4.17-thundering-observatory.webp)

Map 4.17 depicts the Thundering Observatory, including the following features:

- **Lightning Tethers.** The tethers holding up the observatory shed bright light for 50 feet and dim light for an additional 50 feet. They also emit a constant, loud rumble audible for 10 miles. This constant thunder is so intense that any creature within the turret has disadvantage on ability checks and attack rolls. Creatures with resistance or immunity to thunder damage are immune to this disorientation. A creature that touches or enters the tether for the first time on a turn, or that starts its turn in the tether, takes 55 (10d10) lightning damage.
- **Observation Chamber.** The lowest floor of the observatory has transparent crystal walls that offer a spectacular view of the surrounding region. A magic control console made of copper and gold occupies this chamber.

### Thundering Observatory Magic

A creature in the Observation Chamber can use the control console to activate the following properties:

- **Death Ray.** As an action, a creature can use the observatory controls to direct a deadly bolt of magical energy at a point it can see, including locations viewed through the observatory's Remote Viewing property (but not through any other means of scrying or magical sensing). The ray creates a line of destruction 10 feet wide starting from the target point and progressing 100 feet in a direction of the creature's choice. Creatures and objects in that line take 143 (26d10) force damage. A creature reduced to 0 hit points is disintegrated into fine gray ash and can be returned to life only by a *true resurrection* or *wish* spell. A creature that activates this property gains 6 levels of exhaustion. Immunity to lightning or thunder damage reduces the number of levels gained by 1 for each such immunity.
- **Remote Viewing.** As an action, a creature operating the controls can make a DC 20 Intelligence (Arcana) check. On a successful check, the creature can cast the *scrying* spell (spell save DC 17) from the device. A magical image of the target appears before the controls.

### Thundering Observatory Adventures

Here are sample adventure hooks to bring characters to the Thundering Observatory or to give them missions to pursue there.

#### Collateral Damage

Factions consisting of creatures from the *encounter tables* for two kinds of giants in *chapter 3* have damaged the observatory in their struggle for control of the site, and its energy is building toward an overload. To stop the imminent explosion, the characters must negotiate with or get through the fighting creatures to repair the control console.

#### Escalation

**Goliath giant-kin** (see *chapter 6*) who live on one of the nearby mountains are at war with creatures from the *Giant Kin Encounters table* in *chapter 3*. On the brink of destruction, the goliaths hope the observatory they have seen from afar can tip the scales in their favor, and they hire adventurers to secure it.

#### Final Key

A **storm giant** offers the characters a stunning reward if the characters can use the *Star Forge* (in this chapter) to build him a machine component. Once they do, an **adult gold dragon** warns them the giant intends to use the component to activate the Thundering Observatory as a doomsday weapon.

#### Fire When Ready

A **frost giant** plans to use the observatory's Death Ray to destroy her rivals in *Hiatea's Hearth* (in this chapter). The current ruler of Hiatea's Hearth has learned of the giant's plan and implores the characters to thwart it. Creatures from the *Frost Giant Encounters* and *Elemental Air Encounters* tables (see *chapter 3*) defend the observatory.

#### History Lesson

A rock gnome **mage** has pieced together accounts from ancient sites leading to the observatory. Creatures from the *Giant Construct Encounters table* in *chapter 3*, fueled by magical lightning, deny entrance to the turret when the characters escort the gnome there to study.

## Worldroot Sapling

In a remote corner of the world, immense, thorny tree roots twist across the barren ground. In the center of this desolate tangle, an enormous sapling gleams with the green of fresh growth, clearly a young tree despite its prodigious size. This is the Worldroot Sapling, a spark of defiant life amid the remnants of dead plants and ashen ground.

The sapling is a seedling from the world tree Yggdrasil, planted and nurtured by an enigmatic group of giants called the Worldroot Circle (described in *chapter 2*). Some tales speak of the world tree stretching through every plane and world of the multiverse, while others say wicked dragons long ago gnawed on and poisoned the great tree. Whatever the fate of Yggdrasil, the Worldroot Sapling stands as a symbol of hope and the perseverance of life. The life energy of the sapling suffuses the ground in the clearing, and the light it sheds soothes weariness and eases pain.

### Worldroot Sapling Features

![Map 4.18: Worldroot Sapling](img/book/BGG/071-map-4.18-worldroot-sapling.webp)

Map 4.18 depicts the Worldroot Sapling, including the following features:

- **Gnarled Roots.** The great, twisted roots of an enormous dead tree cover a vast area surrounding the sapling. The roots bristle with immense thorns, some up to 5 feet long. The roots can be climbed easily, but a creature that moves more than half its speed on its turn while within 5 feet of the roots must succeed on a DC 15 Strength (Athletics) check or take 11 (2d10) piercing damage.
- **Sapling.** The Worldroot Sapling stands in a clearing created by the twisting roots. The sapling is 30 feet tall, and its trunk is 10 feet in diameter. Despite its size, it has the proportions and appearance of a very young tree. The tree glows with a bright, greenish-golden light for 30 feet, and dim light reaches an additional 30 feet.

### Worldroot Sapling Magic

The Worldroot Sapling has the following properties:

- **Font of Life.** A dead creature buried in the soil within 30 feet of the sapling for 24 hours returns to life as if by a *true resurrection* spell. Once this property has been used, all properties of the sapling are suppressed for 30 days. Alternatively, a dead creature buried in the clearing's soil more than 30 feet from the sapling for 24 hours returns to life as if by a *reincarnation* spell.
- **Invigorating Light.** A creature within the bright light shed by the sapling has advantage on ability checks and saving throws based on Constitution and Wisdom. A creature that finishes a long rest within the bright light removes all levels of exhaustion it has.
- **Life-Giving Sap.** If the sapling's bark is pierced or cut, it bleeds enough golden sap to fill a vial. The sap functions as a *potion of vitality*. A creature that drinks a vial of sap stops aging while it remains within the clearing. The tree can produce 1d4 vials in a 24-hour period, and a vial loses its magic after 24 hours.

### Worldroot Sapling Adventures

Here are sample adventure hooks to bring characters to the Worldroot Sapling or to give them missions to pursue there.

#### Deathly Hunger

Cloud giants of the Worldroot Circle defend the sapling against ravenous Undead who wish to feed on the tree's life energy. The giants send an urgent, magical call for help. **Wraiths**, **vampire spawn**, and creatures from the *Giant Necropolis Encounters table* in *chapter 3* assault the sapling.

#### Persistent Knowledge

A venerable sage is desperate to escape the looming threat of death. Becoming Undead is odious to them, and their search to extend their life led them to the Worldroot Sapling. The sage hires the characters to destroy or disable the thorn-covered versions of creatures from the *Giant Construct Encounters table* (see *chapter 3*) who guard the sapling against all intruders.

#### Rotten Roots

A **stone giant of Evil Earth** (see *chapter 6*) and the giant's evil minions from the *Elemental Earth Encounters table* in *chapter 3* have taken control of the Worldroot Sapling. The cultists are pouring corrupt earth elemental energy into the sapling, twisting it to create a **gargantua** (see *chapter 6*). A **stone giant** seer begs the characters to help her thwart the cult.

#### Spreading Branches

A group of **firbolg primeval wardens** (see *chapter 6*) seek to reconnect the *Forest Crystal* and *Singing Sands* (both in this chapter) to a magical network that once spanned the world. The firbolgs believe they can use the network created by an ancient civilization of giants to channel the sapling's life energy to revitalize devastated regions of the world. They need help carrying cuttings of the sapling to the two sites. Along the way, the characters must deal with creatures from the *Fiendish Incursion Encounters table* at the Singing Sands and with tyrannical giants from the *Storm Giant Encounters table* at the Forest Crystal (both tables are in *chapter 3*).

# Chapter 5: Giant Treasures

*Working together forged our friendship as well as my beneficent bracelet. Afterward, Diancastra delighted in showing me the glory of the giants across the breadth of the multiverse.*— BigbyGiants collect an eclectic assortment of treasures and trinkets over the course of their long life spans. This chapter, intended for the Dungeon Master, explores treasures intrepid adventurers might find during their encounters with giants, focusing on the six main families of giants described in the *Monster Manual*. This chapter contains the following sections:

"*Giant Bags*" provides tables you can use to determine the contents—both valuable and mundane—of a roaming giant's bag.

"*Relics of Giant Realms*" details the variety of valuable treasures left by ancient giants' civilizations.

"*Magic Items*" presents new magic items associated with giants, their legends, and their magic runes.

![](img/book/BGG/072-05-001.bigby-surfer.webp)

## Giant Bags

Giants on the move carry colossal bags containing miscellaneous items collected over many years. Giant bags are strange repositories of unusual mementos, titanic tools, and giant-sized portions of food and drink. This section provides guidance for determining the contents of the bag of a giant of any kind.

Each of the lists in this section includes coinage (replacing the *Individual Treasure tables* in the *Dungeon Master's Guide*), boulders for throwing, and a number of other nonmagical items determined by rolling on another table. These items can include valuable objects, as well as food, tools, and curiosities. At your discretion, any giant bag might also contain a **bag jelly** (described in *chapter 6*).

### Cloud Giant Bags

Most cloud giant bags are sewn from richly dyed fabric and trimmed with gold. Giants who carry such bags thrive on showcasing the full extent of their wealth, and they often carry lavish items to further boast about their riches.

Other cloud giant bags are deceptive: they appear to be small and flat but abound with hidden pockets to stash all manner of items. Giants who carry such bags identify with the trickster aspect of the god Memnor and take pride in their cleverness.

#### Cloud Giant Bag Contents

- 140 (4d6 × 10) sp
- 140 (4d6 × 10) gp
- 10 (3d6) pp

![Adventurers discover the eclectic contents of a cloud giant's bag](img/book/BGG/073-05-002.cloud-giant-bag.webp)

### Fire Giant Bags

Fire giants include many skilled smiths, and some of them create gorgeous pieces from fired clay and blown glass.

Fire giants are often pragmatic, carrying only necessary tools and examples of their finest work. Their bags are sewn from resilient materials like thick leather, designed to withstand the heat of the forge as well as the fire giants' own searing heat.

### Frost Giant Bags

Frost giant bags are coated in waterproof lacquer and lined with thick fur to keep their contents dry in the harsh weather of the giants' arctic domains. In addition to weapons and travel supplies, frost giants like to carry trophies from their battles to boast about.

### Hill Giant Bags

The items found in hill giant bags reflect a diversity of taste and interest as broad as that found among any other giants. Some hill giants carry only food and boulders for throwing, while others collect artistic or scholarly materials that defy stereotypes attached to their kind.

Hill giant bags are made from simple materials like burlap or linen. Most have a distinctive "snack pocket"—a smaller compartment on the side of the bag used to store and easily access food while traveling. Food is of utmost importance to hill giants, and many carry different spices and cooking utensils with them.

### Stone Giant Bags

On a large scale, stone giants love elaborate murals and exquisite carvings. But when it comes to the trinkets in their bags, they favor trinkets that stimulate nonvisual senses, such as musical instruments, textured beads, and fragrant spices. However, many stone giants are fascinated by light and view it as a rare treasure. They cherish objects that generate or interact with light, such as prismatic crystals and bioluminescent flora.

### Storm Giant Bags

With their disposition toward divination, many storm giants are inclined to be superstitious, constantly searching the world for omens. They often carry a multitude of talismans and charms whose nature reflects the storm giant's home. A storm giant who lives in the sea might employ special kelp and shells for divination. A storm giant who spends more time in the sky might view lightning as a harbinger of good fortune and collect talismans made from objects struck by lightning or items that resemble lightning bolts.

## Relics of Giant Realms

Though their inhabitants may be long gone, the ruins of ancient giants' civilizations are littered with valuable treasure for adventurers to discover. The *random treasure* tables in the *Dungeon Master's Guide* can help you quickly generate items characters may find while exploring such ruins. If you want treasures that feel uniquely giant-themed, this section provides suggestions for more distinctive items.

This section can also be used to generate treasure found among still-thriving giant societies; such treasure may have been passed down between generations, created in the imitation of ancient styles, or unearthed by the giants themselves.

### Kinds of Treasure

Use these guidelines in conjunction with the information in the *Dungeon Master's Guide* to detail treasures adventurers might find in ancient ruins built by giants.

#### Coins

Giants' civilizations minted coins using copper, silver, electrum, gold, and platinum. These coins were sized for the creatures that used them and are thus comparatively massive to the average adventurer. (Most coins found in giants' bags are ordinary coins minted by more recent civilizations.)

Giant-made coins vary in shape and design across civilizations, but in general, the coins are about 4 inches in diameter and at least 1/4-inch thick. Due to the sheer amount of precious metal used to make them, these coins are worth ten times more than their normal-sized counterparts. For example, one giant-sized copper coin is worth 10 cp (or 1 sp) and one giant-sized gold coin is worth 10 gp (or 1 pp).

Giant-made coins are also much heavier than normal coins. Five giant-sized coins of any type weigh 1 pound.

#### Gemstones

Jewels and other precious stones cut by smaller folk are too small for most giants to notice, let alone find value in. But ancient giants might have mastered ways of mining and cutting gemstones more appropriate to their size. They also harvested oversized pearls from giant clams.

You can use the "*Gemstones*" section of the *Dungeon Master's Guide* to randomly generate different jewels adventurers might find while plundering a giant's hoard. A giant-cut gemstone is worth ten times its normal value; for example, a giant-cut garnet (a stone on the 100 gp Gemstones table in the *Dungeon Master's Guide*) is worth 1,000 gp.

#### Art Objects

The art objects found in ancient giants' ruins reflect the societies and types of giants that once inhabited them. For example, ancient stone giant art is handsomely carved stonework, often adorned with tactile writing systems to accommodate visitors who aren't accustomed to the lightless depths such giants call home. Meanwhile, storm giant artwork reflects the variety of climes these giants inhabit, with thalassic treasures like pearls and seashells found alongside electroplated metals and jewelry charged with the might of a maelstrom.

In conjunction with the *tables* in the *Dungeon Master's Guide*, you can use the following tables to generate distinctive, giant-sized art objects for a specific ruin or hoard belonging to giants.

## Magic Items

Giants have perfected numerous forms of magical crafting. This section presents new magic items associated with the might of giants.

### A Note about Size

*As described* in the *Dungeon Master's Guide*, magic items meant to be worn can fit a creature regardless of size or build. If your campaign features a lot of magic items made by giants, you might decide to tweak this rule. Consider these two options:

- **Everything Fits.** Perhaps the ancient giants of your world lived among creatures of varying statures, and as such, they took great care to ensure their magic items would resize to comfortably suit their users. With this option, any magic item created by giants (even one that is not worn, such as a wand or a weapon) magically resizes to suit any creature between Small and Huge size. The creature must spend 10 uninterrupted minutes touching the item and must attune to it if it requires attunement.
- **Nothing Resizes.** Perhaps ancient giants made magic items to be used exclusively by giants. In this case, giant-made items don't resize. Smaller creatures might be able to adapt these items in various ways. A giant-made ring can be worn as a bracelet, a giant-made bracelet could serve as a headband, and so on. Some items can't be comfortably wielded by smaller creatures, but magical techniques might exist that allow skilled artisans to reshape and resize magic items with a few days of work.

Some of the magic items described in this chapter have special properties that allow them to fit creatures of any size. For the rest, you can decide whether characters find giant-sized items they need to resize (one way or another) or they find items that were made by giants for smaller allies—or made by smaller creatures using giants' techniques.

>Giant-Crafted Items
>
>Beyond its size, a giant-crafted version of a magic item might look different from its traditional appearance. For example, runes and rune carving are central to the magic traditions of the giants, so a *rod of rulership* created by a giant artisan might be inscribed with the king rune, while a giant-crafted *periapt of wound closure* might bear the life rune. Also, a magic item might absorb some of the latent elemental power of its giant users or creators. A *+1 longsword* forged by a fire giant, for example, could glow faintly like embers in the dark, while the *sentinel shield* once carried by a frost giant could be perpetually cold to the touch.
>
>None of these cosmetic effects alter a magic item's capabilities. They merely provide a narrative link to giants' realms that characters might explore.

# Chapter 6: Bestiary

*At Mordenkainen's side, I thought of giants as a brutal menace threatening the very existence of the world I knew. Diancastra showed me just how small that world was. My eyes have been opened to a world that is much larger and far more ancient than I imagined.*— BigbyAcross the multiverse, giants are shaped by ancient traditions and a powerful connection to the Elemental Planes. This chapter describes dozens of giants and related creatures for use in your game. For guidance on how to use a creature's stat block, consult the *introduction* of the *Monster Manual*.

Herein you'll find weapons that deal unusual damage types and spellcasting that functions in atypical ways. Such an exception is a special feature of a monster and represents how it uses the weapon or casts its spells; the exception has no effect on how a weapon or a spell functions for others.

If a stat block contains the name of a class in the monster's name or in parentheses under the name, the monster is considered a member of that class for the purpose of meeting magic item prerequisites.

The monsters in this chapter are arranged in alphabetical order for ease of reference. Here's an overview of the creatures herein:

- **Extended Family.** This chapter introduces *death giants*, *fensirs* from the Outer Planes, and the monstrous *gargantuas*, as well as primordial *scions of the giant gods*.
- **Magic-Using Giants.** Each of the giants of the ordning has new variants in this chapter. The *cloud giant destiny gambler*, *fire giant forgecaller*, *frost giant ice shaper*, *hill giant avalancher*, *stone giant rockspeaker*, and *storm giant tempest caller* all wield the traditional rune magic of their kind. They are joined by the *death giant shrouded one* and the *fomorian warlock of the dark*, giants outside the ordning that nevertheless wield rune magic.
- **Giant Cultists.** Other variations include giants that follow the cults of "interloper gods." Some of these are Fiends transformed by their devotion to demon lords or archdevils, including the *echo of Demogorgon*, the *fire hellion*, the *fury of Kostchtchie*, the *maw of Yeenoghu*, and the *stalker of Baphomet*. Others are cultists of Elemental Evil: a *cloud giant of Evil Air*, a *fire giant of Evil Fire*, a *frost giant of Evil Water*, and a *stone giant of Evil Earth*. The *fomorian deep crawler* and the *storm herald*—a storm giant transformed into a monstrous Aberration—round out this category.
- **Other Giant Variations.** The unfallen form of fomorians is here, along with a variant ettin (the *ettin ceremorph*) and two versions of trolls (the *troll amalgam* and the *troll mutate*).
- **Elemental Hulks.** Withered branches of the giant family tree, the elemental hulks (*cinder*, *dust*, *lightning*, *mist*, *mud*, and *rime hulks*) are Elemental creatures descended from giants.
- **Undead Giants.** Undead forms of the giants of the ordning appear in this chapter: *barrowghasts*, *cairnwights*, *firegaunts*, *frostmourns*, *spectral clouds*, and *tempest spirits*.
- **Gigantic Animals.** Dinosaurs and other enormous creatures are often found in giants' enclaves. These include four Gargantuan *dinosaurs* (*aerosaur*, *altisaur*, *ceratops*, and *regisaur*), *giant geese*, *giant lynxes*, *giant oxen*, *giant rams*, *giant ticks*, *gigants*, *grinning cats*, *spotted lions*, *storm crabs*, and *titanotheres*.
- **Humanoid Giant Kin.** *Firbolgs* and *goliaths* appear here in a few different varieties.
- **Others.** Two enormous Constructs appear here (the *flesh colossus* and the *runic colossus*), as well as an Ooze that lives in giants' bags—the aptly named *bag jelly*.

Tables at the end of this chapter list all the creatures herein by giant kind, challenge rating, and creature type.

## Creature Lists

This section contains three guides to help you find your way to the right giant (or giant-related creature) for an encounter. First, "*Giants by Kind*" presents seven tables indexing the creatures in this chapter and creatures of the Giant type from other sources.

# Appendix B: Adventure Hooks

This book is full of seeds you can use to craft adventures involving giants and the realms they inhabit. Tables (and text) in chapters *2*, *3*, and *4* present giants as patrons, rivals, or adversaries, or suggest reasons why characters might venture to locations constructed or occupied by giants. The adventure hooks are spread throughout these three chapters because they're intended to complement the information presented in each chapter. For example, if you get excited as you're reading about the giant pantheon and decide you want to build an adventure that features these gods, a table is right there to spark your imagination.

If you're unsure where to start, you can use the Adventure Hooks table here to help you decide.
