# Introduction

![Ship of Space Clowns](img/book/BAM/000-05-000.ship-of-space-clowns.webp)

*Take heart, fellow adventurers, for you have curried the favor of Boo!*— Minsc**Squeak**— BooBoo is a hamster. More precisely, he is a **miniature giant space hamster**—a rather famous one, in fact. Boo's adventures with Minsc the ranger, as well as his ferocity, are legendary. But Boo would be the first to tell you that he is just one of the countless amazing creatures that hail from the starry realm known as the Astral Plane.

Apparently, **giant space hamsters** aren't as bright or as legendary as their smaller cousins. Minsc has shared this information and a host of other pieces of lore from Boo freely and loudly during his travels. This book presents much of that lore, but don't expect commentary from the famous hamster himself. He's too busy saving the multiverse and, as Minsc might put it, "kicking butt for goodness."

## Astral Variants

If you want even more creatures to populate your adventures in space, look no further than the *Monster Manual*. Entities of the Outer Planes such as angels, devils, and slaadi are just as likely to be found on the Astral Plane as they are on any Material Plane world. The same can be said for **aboleths**, giants, **mind flayers**, **umber hulks**, **vampires**, and other *Monster Manual* creatures.

Practically any terrestrial creature can be turned into an astral-dwelling creature, whether it requires air or not. For example, a **stone giant** living on an asteroid might rely on the asteroid's air envelope for survival, or it might not need to breathe air. Similarly, a **mimic** stowing away aboard a spelljamming ship might be an ordinary specimen or one that has adapted to life in Wildspace.

You can turn any terrestrial creature into a Wildspace-dwelling variant by giving it the following trait, if nothing else:

>***Unusual Nature.*** The creature doesn't require air.

## Using a Stat Block

This book is a companion to the *Monster Manual* and uses a similar presentation. If you are unfamiliar with the monster stat block format, read the *introduction* of the *Monster Manual* before proceeding further. That book explains stat block terminology and gives rules for various monster traits—information that isn't repeated here.

The Stat Blocks by Challenge Rating table sorts the creatures in this book by challenge rating.

### Unusual Attacks and Magic

Some creatures have weapons that deal unusual damage types and spellcasting that functions in an atypical way. For example, many astral elves deal extra radiant damage with their weapon attacks. This extra damage isn't a feature of the weapon. Such an exception is a special feature of a stat block and represents how the creature uses its weapon or casts its spells; the exception has no effect on how a weapon or spell functions for a different creature.

### Meeting Magic Item Prerequisites

If a stat block contains the name of a class in parentheses under the creature's name, the creature is considered a member of that class for the purpose of meeting prerequisites for magic items.

## Astral Encounters

You can generate a random encounter on the Astral Plane by rolling on either the *Wildspace Encounters table* or the *Astral Sea Encounters table*, as appropriate, or by choosing an encounter you like. If the encounter is with a spelljamming ship, you can roll on the *Ship Encounters table* to determine the ship and its crew, or you can create a ship encounter of your own (see the *Astral Adventurer's Guide* for *ship descriptions*).

Creatures marked with an asterisk (*) appear in this book; the rest are described in the *Monster Manual*. Any creature marked with a dagger (†) can serve as a spelljammer because it is a spellcaster.

If a Humanoid has no specified race, it can be of any race you choose.

### Initial Attitude

To randomly determine the initial attitude of the creatures encountered, make the attitude roll called for in an encounter table entry, then refer to the appropriate line of the Initial Attitude table.

##### Initial Attitude
| Attitude Roll Total | Initial Attitude |
|:-------------------:|:----------------:|
|      4 or lower     |      Hostile     |
|         5–8         |    Indifferent   |
|     9 or higher     |     Friendly     |
