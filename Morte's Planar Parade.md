# Introduction: Multiversal Menagerie

*"Morte. A self-professed 'famous' planar traveler who often poses as a mimir to–"**"Whoa, hey, hey! Zip it there, bud! I don't know who got you a defective mimir, Chief, but I'll tell you what's what from here out."*— MortePlanar travelers often find *mimirs* invaluable in learning about reality and avoiding doom at the hands, claws, fangs, tentacles, proboscises, ovipositors, and other appendages of the multiverse's countless predatory and lethally grumpy inhabitants.

**Morte**, however, isn't a *mimir*.

A floating skull with a penchant for speaking his mind and claiming expertise, Morte is one of Sigil's many unique inhabitants and an accomplished explorer of the planes. For the right amount of coin or a future favor, Morte is quick to offer his advice, insights, and commentary on the many inhabitants of the planes. This book contains useful data gleaned from Morte's stories and ramblings. Still, the planes are vast and varied, and what Morte experienced as true might not match all circumstances. Reader beware.

## Using a Stat Block

This book is a companion to the *Monster Manual* and uses a similar presentation. If you are unfamiliar with the monster stat block format, read the *introduction* of the *Monster Manual* before proceeding. That book explains stat block terminology and gives rules for various monster traits—information that isn't repeated here.

The *Stat Blocks by Challenge Rating table* sorts the creatures in this book by challenge rating. Most of these creatures appear in the "*Bestiary A to Z*" section, but those marked with an asterisk (*) appear in the "*Faction Agents*" section.

### Unusual Attacks and Magic

Some creatures have weapons that deal unusual damage types and spellcasting that functions in an atypical way. Such an exception is a special feature of a stat block and represents how the creature uses its weapon or casts its spells; the exception has no effect on how a weapon or spell functions for a different creature.

### Meeting Magic Item Prerequisites

If a stat block contains the name of a class in parentheses under the creature's name, the creature is considered a member of that class for the purpose of meeting prerequisites for magic items.

## Petitioners

Petitioners are former mortals. They've lived, ceased living, and now exist on the Outer Planes. They typically inhabit a plane that shares their alignment or the realm of a deity they worship. Some, however, become lost and wander the planes or make new homes for themselves elsewhere on the Great Wheel.

You can make any creature that isn't a Celestial or Fiend a petitioner by giving it the following traits:

>***Plane Locked.*** The creature's creature type changes to Celestial or Fiend (DM's choice), and the creature can't leave the Outer Planes. Portals or magic that allow transport beyond the Outer Planes don't affect this creature.

>***Soul Shape.*** A dead petitioner can be returned to life only by the *true resurrection* spell or the *wish* spell. If affected by these spells, a petitioner chooses whether to return in its original mortal form or as a petitioner.

### Death and the Planes

Mortals that die eventually have their souls return as petitioners in far-flung reaches of the Outer Planes. There, they manifest as idealized versions of themselves. These forms might be similar to the forms they had in life or be those of entirely different creatures. A petitioner or another Celestial or Fiend that is destroyed can reconstitute on a plane that shares its alignment after 100 years, or it might choose to become one with that plane and never return. A creature that re-forms on the planes multiple times becomes increasingly dissimilar from its original mortal form.

## Planar Influences

The Outer Planes are home to powerful forces of good and evil, chaos and order. Over time, these forces can alter creatures exposed to them. Due to their proximity to the Outer Planes, the inhabitants of the Outlands' gate-towns and nearby regions often exhibit traits associated with specific Outer Planes. Creatures might also have such traits if they dwell in other realms steeped in the energy of an Outer Plane—whether such a place be in the Outlands, on the Material Plane, or elsewhere.

This section provides customization options for creatures exposed to the energies of the Outer Planes for months or years. Creatures influenced by a plane can have as many or as few of these traits as you choose.

*"Anything you think you know about critters from the Material Plane doesn't apply in the Outlands, Chief. Your dog back home ain't nothing like a hound from the Nine Hells or Mount Celestia. Only thing those planar sorts have in common is that neither wants to hear about how you're 'totally a dog person.'"*— Morte
### Planar Alignment

In addition to the plane-specific traits you can grant a creature, the influence of a plane changes a creature's alignment to match the plane's alignment, as shown on the Outer Plane Alignments table. If a plane a creature is influenced by has more than one alignment, you choose the creature's alignment from the options listed.

This reduction never exceeds 10 feet.

>***Torturous Teleport.*** An invisible, magic-disrupting aura surrounds the creature.

*"The planes work on you in all sorts of ways, Chief. Sometimes they'll change your hair or give you spots. Other times they'll turn you into the sort of ugly little worm fiends love to snack on. If you're planning to visit one of the Outer Planes, best to keep your stay short–if you ever want to leave at all."*— Morte

## Denizens of the Outlands

As the Outlands are the crossroads of the Outer Planes, travelers in that realm might encounter any creature in existence, many of which have been influenced by other planes. The following sections detail the various creature types likely to be encountered in the Outlands. Use the tables in these sections to inspire encounters and whole adventures in the Outlands.

>Planar Exemplars
>
>Some creatures originate on specific Outer Planes. Just as flesh and blood are fundamental to many creatures from the Material Plane, the forces of these creatures' home planes are fundamental to their being. These creatures are manifestations of a plane itself and are altered by other planar influences only under unusual circumstances. The archons of Mount Celestia, the demons of the Abyss, the devils of the Nine Hells, the modrons of Mechanus, and the slaadi of Limbo are just a few examples of such children of the planes.
>
>As a result, it's rare to encounter a group of modrons embracing the chaos of Limbo or devils awash in the natural energy of the Beastlands. It's up to you to decide what creatures are exemplars of their home planes and under what circumstances they might be influenced by other planes.

### Aberrations

With their inscrutable biologies and agendas, Aberrations might journey to the Outlands pursuing all manner of schemes or sustenance. Slaadi from Limbo are among the most common Aberrations found on the Outlands.

### Beasts

Varied Beasts roam the Outlands, with many species being long extinct on Material Plane worlds. Plane-influenced creatures and gigantic or idealized animals from the Beastlands are common.

### Celestials

Various Celestials watch over the Outlands, particularly those reaches that border the Upper Planes. Angels and *archons* (presented later in this book) are particularly common. Some seek to prevent fiendish incursions into the plane, while others try to align the Outlands closer to goodly philosophies.

|  3  | A fallen **deva**, now neutral aligned, is on permanent vacation. The mellow angel is a font of multiversal secrets, but it shares them only with strangers who prove themselves more relaxed than it.                         |
|  4  | A **couatl** influenced by *Limbo* has color-changing wings and insists passersby convince it that they're worthy of existing. If the couatl isn't convinced, it has a 50 percent chance of either attacking or wandering off. |

### Constructs

Constructs in the Outlands might be the remnants of forgotten civilizations, servants of plane-walking magic-users, or creations with varied important or ridiculous purposes. Among the most common are modrons, mechanical denizens of Mechanus that seek to enforce order on the plane.

### Dragons

All varieties of Dragons can be found in the Outlands, though many dwell in isolated reaches away from the plane's gate-towns.

Being close to nature—even the surreal nature of the Outer Planes—Fey dwelling in the Outlands are often influenced by other planes. Fey encountered near a gate-town typically exhibit influences from the town's associated Outer Plane.

##### Outlands Fey

Monstrosities are common in the Outlands. Due to the influence of the Outer Planes, many behave differently than they might on the Material Plane.

##### Outlands Monstrosities
|  d4 | Encounter                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

### Plants

Plants in the Outlands often grow to incredible size, produce remarkable flowers or fruit, and exhibit bizarre shapes and colors. Regions influenced by other planes are typically first recognizable by the effect those planes have on vegetation.

|  4  | A resident of the gate-town of *Ecstasy* is missing. His garden of **twig blights**—influenced by *Elysium* to resemble topiary sculptures—haven't been fed and now sow chaos in town.           |

### Undead

Undead often lurk in the dismal reaches of the Outlands, but some wander the land, either seeking places to spend eternity or preying on the living.

##### Outlands Undead
|  d4 | Encounter                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

|  2  | A **banshee** influenced by *Acheron* appears as a fallen knight-commander with a legion of **specters**. Guardians of the gate-town of Rigus hire the characters to help banish the phantom army.                                               |
|  3  | A **lich** seeks to dominate the gate-town of Hopeless and see it dragged into Hades with himself as its ruler. Citizens of the gate-town entreat the characters to keep the gate-town hopeful enough that it doesn't fall into the Lower Plane. |
